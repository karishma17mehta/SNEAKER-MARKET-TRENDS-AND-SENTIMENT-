i have two 350 v2's size 14.5 (half size up from TTS) and they fit me perfectly. TTS is 14 US.

yeezy,Should I return my new Yeezy 350 v2 Dark Salt?,"I‚Äôve just bought a pair of Yeezys Dark Salt size 9, I am usually wearing 8.5 so I went up .5 as most of the recommendations say, but when I tried them on, they are quite tight on the feet. Toes are pretty snug, got the in sole out but still pretty tight. After 1 hour of wearing them I could feel more comfortable in the shoes but still tight. 

I have an old pair of Ozweego size 9.5 which are slightly big for my feet, nothing uncomfortable, just a bit loose than what I‚Äôd usually wear.

My question is: Should I return these Yeezys and go for a 9.5 size pair? Or should I keep them and wear them for a few weeks until they start loosening up? Any similar experiences or advice? 

My concern is that if I go another half size up, they would be too loose and would look weird on foot.

Thanks! ",0,16,2025-04-17 02:41:09,Sneakers

yeezy,Sneaker suggestions for casual wedding,"I have a wedding coming up next month (I'm not the one getting married). The dress code guideline provided was:

""We'd love to see everyone dress up for this day! Think garden party formal; midi or floor-length dresses, color, and casual suits. Please no denim, or flip flops, and avoid shades of white.""

If this wedding had a stricter dress code, like wearing a tuxedo or formal black suit, I would just wear dress shoes, but the dress code is more lax and less strict.

I will be wearing a beige suit -> beige blazer and beige pants.  

Any suggestion what shoes would make the fit look fire?

yeezy,Why are the Jordan 4 black cats (2020) so expensive compared to similar?,"I‚Äôve been out of the shoe game for a few years, but I recently started looking at prices again to see what I could sell my DS extras for. 

My collection is about 80% Jordans and 20% Yeezys. I wasn‚Äôt surprised to see that the value of Yeezys tanked bc Ye is doing crazy shit, but I was surprised how much Jordans tanked. What really surprised me was that Black Cat 4s are going for near 1k in my size (10.5). Other Jordan 4s from around 2020 that are just as popular (Breds, Carolina blue, lightnings) are in the $400 range. Why are black cars so expensive? I know it‚Äôs a popular colorway but I‚Äôd expect it to be on the same popularity level as breds and Carolina blues. Was there a really short production run for the black cats?

yeezy,If you only buy the hype your not a true ‚ÄúSneakerHead‚Äù,"Since I was 5 I‚Äôve always wanted shoes. I would spend my time cleaning my shoes organizing them lacing them up. As I got older my collection got insane at one point I had over 300 pairs of shoes. But they weren‚Äôt all Jordans , Yeezy , or anything special . Myself personally at anytime if I see a shoe I like I buy it doesn‚Äôt matter the brand the colorway or silhouette, if I like em I buy em. There‚Äôs been so many shoes over the years that many turned their nose up and now you see em sought after. I wore vans before they were cool, crocs , adidas, Etnies, Osiris, New Balance. I now get to share my passion with my son who weeed the same size. We have a show room and now when I buy shoes I‚Äôm buying us shoes. My point of the post is this, don‚Äôt follow the hype don‚Äôt care what people think if you like em cop em and rock em, Being a sneaker head is more than buying the hottest or hardest to snatch shoe. So cheers to All my fellow Real true sneaker heads.

yeezy,Sneaker Rotation Check,"I decided that it's time to rotate into my 2025 Spring rotation (definitely jumping in too early). I thought very carefully on what I'll be using just because I need to wear some of my shoes that I kept in boxes. I have a weird/random taste in shoes, my friends say. But I love sneakers! I have too much. I hope my rotation keeps up for these few months even though it probably won't, but wear all your sneakers. Currently Asics has my heart if you can't tell. I don't gate keep because I am a huge advocate for buying stuff you like. I like to consider myself a niche hypebeast, even though I have never owned a Jordan/Nike shoe for over 1 month. I hate that there's no universal guide for shoe sizing, so I hope this helps slightly. 

Left Side Top to Bottom:

Asics Gel Lyte III Nippon Blue (TTS fits more snug for wide footers)

Yeezy 500s Utility Black (TTS; beater of the group and my favorite and only silhouette of Yeezys (I have the Supermoons too). My historic Pre-Covid shoe lol)

Asics x Kiko Gel Kiril (TTS needs to break in)

Asics Gel Kayano 14 Birch (TTS most comfy from the jump!)

Right Side Top to Bottom:

Asics x Andersson Bell Protoblast (Half Size Up!; comfy and bouncy like a high school basketball shoe)

Balenciaga Track Sandals (Half Size Down/Euro Size, fits weird on the top part. Atleast it has adjustable velcro straps. Very Chunky! Always need a sandal for rotation imo.)

New Balance x Aime Leon Dore (TTS has a weird footbed for my flat/wide feet, but super comfy! High top is also essential for rotation!)

yeezy,"I'm looking for a sneaker recommendation. I'm not really a sneakerhead, so forgive me if this isn't allowed here.","My girlfriend and I are going to Japan in late September, so I'm looking for a sneaker that will look nice with more casual looks (chinos and maybe a polo or jeans and a t-shirt) and can be comfortable for days filled with at least five miles of walking- if not double that. However, most of the sneakers I see recommended on YT tend to look more like running shoes, and I'm really not into how wearing running shoes without athletic clothing looks.

My girlfriend is a huge Yeezy fan, so she's been incessantly advocating for the Boost 380s to the point she turns the conversation back to 380s (and the 350s to a lesser extent) when I show her a different shoe that catches my eye (even other Yeezys), but I'm just not sold on the socks-with-soles sneakers since they look like running shoes and we'll be in Japan during typhoon season.

I generally like sneakers that are more neutral and versatile since I'm not a collector, and can't afford to have a shoe for every outfit. Up to now I would typically wear Vans (right now I'm wearing a pair of tan Vans MTE Sk8-His most of the time) or a pair of Stan Smiths during warmer months since they can both work in an office setting. However, for Christmas my girlfriend got me some More Uptempos that I now occasionally work into the rotation for casual Fridays since I have a huge amount of nostalgia for them. I got a pair of them in 2nd grade as a reward for finally mastering tying my own shoes, and I had wanted another pair ever since a growth spurt destroyed them (also George of the Jungle).

So far ones that have caught my eye are some colorways of Yeezy 500s, 700s, and Adidas Ozweegos. Of those, I've heard the Ozweegos were the most comfortable, and they're about $50 cheaper. I'm not really married to any particular brand as long as they're comfortable, durable, have a clean look, can go with a lot of outfits, and aren't crazy expensive.",0,6,2025-02-26 07:05:52,Sneakers

I see lots of sneakers that used to be in high demand now selling for $100 or even lower. There's no way Kanye or the brand recovers from this anymore.

yeezy,Looking for gift ideas for my sneaker-loving husband for Valentine‚Äôs Day,"I‚Äôve browsed similar posts from the past and hoping someone can help improve my very notice knowledge of sneakers to get something nice for my husband. He has quite a few Jordan‚Äôs, nothing too flashy, usually wears them to work. I notice he prefers his Adidas (sambas, and similar styles, no Yeezy please) on most days and he says they fit him much better (this is also my experience). So I‚Äôm wondering if I get him a unique pair of Jordan‚Äôs or look in the Adidas family since we both prefer the fit? I was also looking at Alohas and P448, but they feel like a much bigger risk stylistically. He will occasionally get a collab shoe (that he keeps in the box) and some rare ones, but I would say he generally stays within the common color pallet (grays, whites, blacks, tans, with accent colors). He won‚Äôt be using them for much aside from walking, and Im hoping to spend $300-500 for something he‚Äôll actually really enjoy. We‚Äôre both workaholics and I haven‚Äôt spent this much on shoes before but am now able to and want to ensure it‚Äôs a good choice!

yeezy,Sneaker shopping in Harajuku üáØüáµ,"Went sneaker shopping in Harajuku/Shibuya yesterday some random thoughts on what I saw, for the record I copped absolutely nothing as no shops had what I was looking for in a size12.

\-Yeezy 350hype in Tokyo is officially over once upon a time you could walk in Harajuku and see hundreds of people wearing 350s, thats dead..

\-asics gel 14 tax is unreal, this was a planned cop, visited the flagship asics store at the takehista dori intersection bottom of hill. They had 4 color ways only one (white color way) the tai chi... largest size was 9.5 US. Saw another shop on Cat St selling the Gel14 cream for like ¬•40,000 didn't even bother to ask for my size. Should've copped these on Goat before my trip.

\-Dunk low hype is over as well, you still see them on feet but every store is stocked from all the ABC marts and I mean all of them to resell shops to Nike flagship in Omotesando. Panda hype is dead dead.

\-Off white dunk lows(new) can be had for under $300 USD saw a few color ways for Ôø•51,000 with 20% off sticker along with tax free, some shop on Cat St

\-New balance is charging hard at least in Japan they've been gaining traction for 3yrs I'd say and lots of people rocking Asics for sure.

  
\- Travis Scott sneakers seem to be the new Yeezy within Tokyo lots of people gravitating to his sneakers at these shops, SB dunks(bright color ways) gaining some traction  

In closing no cops hitting up Ginza today if I see anything worth adding I will. Disclaimer: I lived in Japan for 4 years and visit frequently for work, my opinion on the sneaker vibe and hype is solely mine ",4,1,2025-01-24 14:40:51,Sneakers

I‚Äôve always admired Kanye‚Äôs work and how he has influenced sneaker culture with his innovative and unique designs. Yeezys are undeniably iconic but not always easy on the wallet and most of them start to get extinct.

I am on the hunt for sneakers that embody a similar aesthetic. Futuristic, minimalistic, and unique but at a price point below $120. Any suggestions for brands or specific models that capture the Yeezy vibe without breaking the bank

I'm not aiming to play in the NBA or anything, but I do work near an indoor basketball court and end up playing from time to time.

For context:

* I've been a big Nike wearer for most of my life. My second favorite shoes were the Free Run 5.0s.

yeezy,My new Radical Orca‚Äôs from Flowers for Society,"This brand is relatively new and not very well known/documented, but since I liked their designs a lot I decided to take a plunge regardless.

I went with the Radical Orca because the black & white colourways are ever green  and the most versatile(allowing me to rock them whenever I want)

They are made with beyond leather, are 100% and made with recycled materials (Which can be a relevant factor for some people who are concerned). I, however, bought them purely because of the design language and their claim regarding being super comfortable.

And I must say, they are very comfortable(can be worn through the day easily), however, they are obviously not as comfortable as something like my adidas ultraboosts or Yeezys.

I went with my true to size(11.5 UK) since my feet are bit wide but I would suggest going down half a size if you plan on buying them.

They definitely grab the attention of people from time to time and you‚Äôll most likely be asked about them sooner or later.

Their box is rather basic but quite robust so it‚Äôs very functional and follows their environment friendly narrative. (I‚Äôve included a picture alongside my adidas bad bunny‚Äôs for refrence).

Some of my nitpicks:- (they‚Äôre not big deals imo)
1. They‚Äôre pretty hefty so if you don‚Äôt like that then you may not like them as much.
2. Their sole is pretty stiff so if you want a squishy sneaker I‚Äôd say these aren‚Äôt for you.
3. The Tongue is easy to push down while trying to wear the shoe so you need to pull it up a bit while squeezing your foot in. (So they‚Äôre not meant to be slipped on)

Overall: i absolutely love them and could not recommend them enough. I would definitely suggest giving them a try since they‚Äôre not that expensive. (I paid ‚Ç¨180 including delivery)",12,1,2024-09-28 02:46:32,Sneakers

I‚Äôm sorry if this question has been asked before as I imagine it‚Äôs a pretty common situation.

Long story short, I bought some Yeezys off the adidas site because they had a sale going on. 

I‚Äôm usually a size 10 in most shoes, but I was unsure on what size to get because they kept recommending me size 9.5, 10, and 10.5 depending on what shoe I was looking at. 

I ended up buying the Yeezy 700 v3 copper fade in size 10. 

Weeks later they have arrived and they don‚Äôt fit‚Ä¶ I need a 10.5

Well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm unable to get a return/refund/exchange so I‚Äôm pretty much screwed.

Now that I‚Äôm making a good income and have money to spend on nice things, I wanted to start building my sneaker collection. I‚Äôd say my taste is pretty mainstream ‚Äî I love Nike and Adidas shoes. I usually prefer sneakers that are mainly white or light-colored. I‚Äôm not into pairs that *everyone* has (like Oreo Dunks).

I don‚Äôt have a strong preference for brand. My priorities are:

1. Comfort
2. Aesthetic/look
3. Price

I‚Äôm looking to learn from you all since you‚Äôve been in the game much longer than I have.

# Questions:

* **Shoe recommendations** (please include colorway ‚Äî not looking for anything $500+)
* **Best places to discover new pairs**
* **Where to buy sneakers** (retail or resale)
* **Tips on proper sneaker care/cleaning** (and how to avoid wearing holes in the soles ‚Äî I tend to wreck my pairs)

# My Collection (so far):

* Undefeated x Ultraboost 1.0 'Stars and Stripes' (thinking about buying a second pair ‚Äî mine are beat and starting to get holes)
* Air Max 1 (mostly white with some blue and black)
* Jordan 11 Mid 'University Blue' (these are mostly for display)
* Basic Nike Running Shoes (just for running ‚Äî not too attached)
* Foam RNNR 'MX Granite' (just picked these up, excited to wear them)

Appreciate any help and advice!",2,24,2025-05-01 10:13:23,Sneakers
air jordan,Help me find the corresponding shirt?,"I was clearing out my closet and found these white-multicolor Jordan Air 1‚Äôs. They have Aqua blue, Light Pink, Apple Green, and Yellow on each of the swooshes and laces. 

I remember there was a shirt I bought along with it that I eventually(and regretfully) got rid of. It was a white long sleeve with the Nike logo all over the chest/stomach area, and the logos where in the same colors as the colors on the shoes. 

Anyone have an idea of what the shirt is called or a link to where I can find it? Would very much like to have that as a fit again as I have been losing weight and am beginning to feel more comfortable with myself. 

Also, yes I‚Äôm aware the shoes aren‚Äôt in the best condition but I‚Äôm going to try and clean them up a bit. ",0,1,2025-04-30 19:48:05,Sneakers

air jordan,You really can't tell leather quality by just look at a photo. Bred 85's breaking leather getting softer by the day!,"I'm not saying this is high quality ""premium leather""(whatever that even is on Jordans), but a whole bunch of sneaker heads thought this was terrible leather just by looking at photos before they came out and thought it looked like air force leather ü§¶üèª.
These shoes were stiff as hell out of the box, and just now after nearly 3 weeks of daily wear are they starting to really soften up a bit, but even then the outter toe box area is still pretty stiff. Can't press down very much without a good amount of force like you could your normal Jordan 1's work for this amount of time.
 
I wore the Black Toe Reimagined everyday for a similar time and those are way softer, but you can tell the leather isn't as good as these.

I'm no leather expert, but I've had experience with Red Wing Iron Ranger, Wolverine 1000 mile boots, Thursday boots, and even Alden, though those were brand new and never wore them, so can't judge how the feel after breaking in. These Bred 85's feel very nice, and I know they're going to feel even better in the coming weeks and months.

TL;DR: YOU CANT JUDGE LEATHER QUALITY JUST BY LOOKING AT PHOTOS LOL AND TUMBLED DOESNT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN GOOD QUALITY",80,19,2025-04-29 18:57:40,Sneakers

air jordan,Need help with sizing,"Hey lads,

I'm a relatively new sneaker head and looking to increase my collection. Never really bought shoes online or bought them frequently, hence i barely know my size. The only brand of sneakers I got was Adidas and mostly received running shoes and recently football shoes, which are size 10. I'm 100% that size 10 (mens) is my adidas size as I recently copped a pair of Samba XLGs (black and white with gum) and those fit perfectly.

However, in terms of Nike, I got a pair of Air Force 1 Lv8s - Cannon Rust with the snakeskin pattern (which were quite huge in the toe box, me being unaware of AF1s running large than normal Nike sneakers. I somehow managed to resolve the situation by adding an insole, which i really didnt want but dont mind cause i really like the shoe.

Currently I'm looking to cop the Air Jordan 1 low ""Cranes"" by Rui Hachimura, and I dont know what size i should go for. Based on what I've measured and identified, I'd fit a size 10 but I'm still not confident and keep overthinking, cause i dont wanna make the same mistake as i did before and order the wrong size. 

My foot size is around 26.3 ish to around 27 roughly (right foot measured only), and I have relatively wide feet, hence adidas size 10 fits well with just enough room.

Hope to not be a burden on this community, would really love some advice and insight from all Sneakerheads, which I hope to become someday. <3",0,2,2025-04-19 09:42:32,Sneakers

air jordan,Been away for a min‚Äî what happened w/ AJ1s?,"Like is it just oversaturation? I can still fit most of my shoes from since I was 18/19, and I have way more than I can count and have my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äôs,‚Äù so while adulting, I haven‚Äôt really needed to buy new shoes at all. Hell, maybe two years ago, I just so happened to be wearing my Laney 14s while on a road trip and someone asked me if I had just picked them up, so I‚Äôm guessing they retro‚Äôd not too long ago. Anyway, since the 2010s, AJ1s have been my faves, since they‚Äôre just so easy to incorporate into almost any fit. Breds, Royals, Lance Mountains, the Allstar Chameleons, and the Melo black & gold being some of my favorites, but I could go on forever.

Been in a pretty good place financially, so out of curiosity, I looked at the GOAT app and have been shocked at the prices, especially since some of these going under retail would be sold out instantly 5 - 10 yrs ago. Like those black and metallic gold melo‚Äôs w/ black suede? Those were sold out and going a bit above retail. Yet the recent black and gold AJ1 that released which is almost identical, is all leather like the classics, does *NOT* have the jumpman on the back, AND even has ‚ÄúNike Air‚Äù on the tongue versus the Melo tag. These would‚Äôve been going for AT LEAST double. Yet I was able to get them for $71 with an offer on GOAT lol. The other one that‚Äôs insane to me is the satin breds. I remember being HEATED I couldn‚Äôt get these, super unique in an iconic color way with a luxurious take on a classic. Everyone SEEMED to feel that way when they released in 2016 or so too and sold out immediately. Yet‚Äî now because they released more generally in women‚Äôs sizes (I was able to get a 10.5/9, so lucky me‚Äî also under retail), i‚Äôve seen people saying the satin is whack lol. I need y‚Äôall to say the satin SBB‚Äôs are whack too so I can get those at retail. I wish I knew the satin black toes were on there for the low before I got the reimagined‚Äôs (which‚Äî also would be instant sellouts back in the day).

I‚Äôm not mad at all so many good ones are on there for under retail. Even though I‚Äôve got quite a few classics, I can‚Äôt help but wear my shoes selectively. I‚Äôve never been on the resale wave. I even told my brothers they better take a look now while in this lull, since let‚Äôs be real‚Äî eventually, at some point, AJ1s will likely be hot again. Just like AF1s, Timbs, some Adidas models, etc. they‚Äôre iconic and will always look good with the right fits.

air jordan,How Do You Price Sneakers? Because This Is Wild.,"I‚Äôve seen price differences before, but this one really makes me question the sneaker market.

Same shoe. Luka Donƒçiƒá x Air Jordan 36 Slovenia.
Same size. US Men‚Äôs 12.

But here‚Äôs where it gets crazy:
	‚Ä¢	StockX price: $300 (last sale was $450)
	‚Ä¢	GOAT price: $1,256 (yes, over $1,200!)

How does that even make sense?

I get that sneaker values fluctuate, but a $900+ difference for the exact same shoe on two platforms? That‚Äôs wild. Are GOAT sellers just hoping someone will overpay? Is StockX actually the better gauge for real market value?

For me, this pair has sentimental value‚ÄîI won them in a Slovenian sports outlet raffle‚Äîbut I still can‚Äôt justify paying four figures for a pair of Jordan 36s.

I‚Äôd love to hear your take: Which app do you trust more when valuing your collection?

I know they are in bad shape but I may try get them restored back to white soles as I‚Äôve had them for a while. 

Anyone know specifically what else are, if they are worth anything or even if they are legit ?

On inside the sku says made 05/14/08 made in china 350571-151

any insight is appreciated thank you.

I don‚Äôt understand the business reason for Nike releasing very limited stock and doing these raffles. They don‚Äôt see any money from the resale. StockX, etc does.

I understand scarcity creates hype. But does it actually help Nike? I would argue it doesn‚Äôt help at all. It limits their profits and diverts money to StockX and resellers.

It would be great if they moved to how they did the Low Poly .SWOOSH release. Which was preorder all day on 1 day. After that it‚Äôs closed for manufacturing. I imagine releases would still be hyped and somewhat limited, Nike would increase profits, and collectors could actually collect more affordably.

I like pretty much everything that looks like dunks, but aren't dunks.

My biggest concerns regarding this decision are as follows:

\- A lot of people on here mention a quality difference between regular 1's and OG's, but i don't know important/noticable that is, and the OG's typically (in my opinion) have worse designs.

\- The Air Force 1's i know will look great, however they probably get dirty quite fast and have it be very noticable

\- The Low Panda's are probably the ones that fit what i'm looking for the best, however for some reason i can only find them in women's, i don't know if i really means anything, if the mens version is any different or even a thing.

\- The leather on the Concords's looks sick, but i don't know how it'll look with time.

If you have any opinions or notes i should take into consideration, please feel free to share. (i'm of course also open to other suggestions.)

I should probably add that i'm not a big sneakerhead, i just think these are kind of shoes i like best.",0,3,2025-03-10 10:43:28,Sneakers

The  second time I went in, they recommended the extra wide. The first time I got fitted (a while back), they said just wide was fine. I have very wide, duck-like feet, so I went with their latest recommendation and got the extra wides.

They actually felt fine when I tried them on in the store. Comfortable enough that I went ahead and bought them. But once I started working out in them, my feet felt super fatigued and worn out after just half a mile. It‚Äôs even worse during my Orangetheory Fitness workouts, where I need shoes that can handle treadmill, floor, and weight room work.

I‚Äôve also tried using insoles with them, but they felt way too hard and didn‚Äôt help.

Before these, I was using a pair of Asics Gel Contend 4 shoes I bought five years ago ‚Äî they went on a long hiatus, but when I brought them back out, they still felt fine up until very recently. That‚Äôs what finally pushed me to get new shoes.

So now I‚Äôm wondering:

asics,AJ1 Low '85 Sizing,"https://preview.redd.it/uxfxvo5r4kwe1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=481f12296d213d646d2a491d54d29742a7a5c704

Considering picking these up for the summer, however I am unsure of the sizing. I have heard I should go TTS, but I'm not sure whether my TTS is 7.5 or 8.

I wear a 7.5 in adidas gazelles, 8 in Air max 90, adidas samba and pretty much any new balance or asics. I also fit a GR AJ1 low, fit at 7.5, slightly narrow but nothing that breaking them in couldn't fix, wouldn't want it any longer as that length was perfect.

I like the thumb's width space in the front and not absolutely pressing my toes, I don't mind having to break them in.

Should I pick up a 7.5 or an 8?  
I can't really pick up both, as I'd have to pay a lot extra for sending one pair back.

Btw: I want to order them from footdistrict as they have fairly low shipping costs. Are they legit?

asics,Lifestyle Shoe Recommendations,"Hi,

I'm coming off of ultraboosts after ~5 years and am looking to see what's better out there.

My primary criteria are breathability (dont like stinky shoes/socks), comfort (easy to put on, somewhat stretchy, etc.), and style (will wear almost every day, so likely triple black just so it fits daily life and in-office work).

Activities: Everyday standing/walking, standard gym use (elliptical).

I know there have been posts in the past, but its nice to get some fresh recommendations. Some of what I'm currently looking into but am not beholden to are:

Hoka Clifton (Heard a lot of good things about comfort and breathability, but not sold on the style)
Asics Nimbus
Nike Invincible

asics,Pureboosts vs Gel-Cumulus 26 (vs 26 GTX?),"Hi everybody,

my current shoes I use for both running and whatever other errand requires me to go outside (i.e. any activity that I don't dress up better for) are absolutely falling apart and starting to hurt my feet, which is why I'm looking to replace them. However, I find it incredibly difficult to choose what to buy given just how many brands exist, and within the brands just how many models...

I wore a pair of Ultraboosts from 2020 until now and really liked them - they were extremely comfortable. However, I'm trying to save a bit at the moment and can't find good sales on those and don't feel like shelling out 180 bucks, and I also don't care about brand and design etc anymore like I did a couple years back, so give me rainbow or poop colored shoes for all I care as long as they support my feet well, are good for running, and don't cost too much. (On the topic of color, why *do* so many models from basically all brands have such horrible color palettes? What's with all the neon and many different colors on one shoe? I don't care right now, but if I did shop based on design I feel like 90% of those could go straight to the bin)

I went to a store and tried on Hoka Clifton 9's, Asics Gel-Cumulus 26's, and NB M880A14s. They had a camera in the store to apparently judge how well the shoe supports your foot, and the conclusion seemed to be that the Gel-Cumulus 26's were the best. (They didn't have time to make me try on more pairs)

However, I also just found Pureboosts on a great sale online, and since I really liked my ultraboosts I'm wondering how they compare, not just to my ultraboosts, but also to the Gel-Cumulus 26s that I tried on. Is there a rule of thumb here? (Also, what's the difference between the Cumulus26 and Cumulus26 GTX?)

asics,Ultimate(ish) Guide to Onitsuka Tiger Alternatives,"So tigers are definitely getting popular, they're also difficult or expensive to get your hands on and I've noticed a decent amount of threads/in person conversations where people ask what are good alternatives - and usually the answer is *Sambas* which has always pissed me off because there are other alternatives **by adidas** that I think better emulate the form and it just feels like a copout answer.

Like many recent young professionals I had the privilege of being able to vacation in Japan for a bit and I also had the privilege of buying (and falling in love) with my first pair of Onitsuka Tigers, the classic Mexico 66 SD. While I was there I also really wanted to get a pair of EDR 78 but couldn't bring it along and they weren't available on the online store for another few months (and when they did become available I had to shell out almost $180 and got extremely lucky it was in my size). So I've been looking at shoes that achieve similar goals and here's my findings.

### What makes Tigers Special
This is gonna be different for everyone, I've heard people say that its the stripes (which never made sense to me???) but for me it's: lightweight thin materials, unique silhouette, (literal) small footprint, muted colors, and good arch support (I'm flat footed). I love the retro, athletic inspired, designs. So this is what I'll be focusing on for the comparison. Also I understand the reluctance to drop so much money on a pair of shoes you can't try on (which generally run a bit small but kinda stretch to your size, I'd recommend just dropping about half you're normal size or get your normal size)

### Qualification for Alternatives
So obviously I'd like them to match the aforementioned features, but outside of that this is a guide primarily focused on **US domestic market** with recent availability (so no Nike drops or whatever they're calling them now). Focus on cost too, if the shoes are >$150 at that point you really should just buy the real thing. Most of these shoes I've seen in person, tried, or bought, which I will mention. And for those I haven't as I shop around I'll try to remember to come back and update this, and do mention any you recommend.

# Mexico 66/66 SD
Starting off with the hard one, because there's really no shoe like it. This is absolutely one where I recommend buying off the site or used. With that said, I think what's going for this model is its lightweight materials and unique silhouette

## Adidas SL 72 (tried on)
these are my go to alternatives as most of the outfits where I feel like my Mexico 66 shine, it could easily swap in 

**Pros**

- genuinely shocked me with how much it looked like the tigers I was wearing (granted they were womens' sized)

- similar silhouette 

- similar color schemes

- eva midsole + rubber spiked bottom, similar walking feel, Tigers are spikier lol don't walk on carpet with them


**Cons**

- mostly being sold in women sizes, definitely recommend going in store to size them

- thicker top material

- look somewhat like a cross between Mexico 66 and EDR 78

## Adidas Japan Shoes (seen in person)
**Pros**
- lightweight material 

- unique silhouette 

- rubber outsole

**Cons**

- not the same silhouette as Mexico 66

- two color options

## Adidas Samba 62 (seen in person, see I'm not a Sambas hater)
These aren't Mexico 66 however, due to their unique, retro sneaker look and the fact that they come from the same era of shoes, means I do recommend these as ""pinch hitters"" so to speak. Definitely get them on sale tho. These, the Japan Shoes, and Mexico 66 are all retro track inspired shoes that will make people turn their heads, and at the end of the day isn't that what this is all about

**Pros**

- lightweight material

- rubber outsole

**Cons**

- disimilar silhouette 

- one color

- thicker top material, but not as thick as Samba OG

## Honorable Mentions
**Adidas R71s/Dragons**, can't seem to get my hands on them in the US but they're pretty cheap and similar to the SL 72s, if anyone else wants to throw their hat in on this. I also saw [these](https://imgur.com/a/9KBbxIW) **Reebok Campio XT** which did look similar from the top and side (from a distance) but they have a different silhouette, however the Reebok white stripes do evoke the Asics stripes and if two people were wearing both shoes and quickly walked past me I don't think I could tell the difference. Plus at Journey's they were $40.

# Serrano
Thin soled like the Mexico 66 and carrying over features of the same unique silhouette but featuring a thicker top material (suede, leather, polyester) and more cushioning.

## ASICS Skyhand OG
yeah this one is pretty easy, you get basically everything, including the stripes, I've seen these go as low as $50. I don't see any reason to look for anything else. I saw a thread that recommended Nike Waffle Trainer 2, but the only models of that shoe that look similar are from their limited release SNKRS platform so didn't include them.

**Cons**

- much thicker outsole

# Mexico 66 Delegation

Thick comfort focused outsole versions of the Mexico 66, I don't remember seeing these in Japan but they look very similar to the GSM 
## ASICS Japan S
Again, easy choice, but this does come down on which color way you're looking at. For my example I chose the black cream, but the stitching on the outsole does look a lot like the GSM. I believe these look more like the Mexico 66 Delegation than the GSM, but these do look a lot like the GSM.

# GSM

Tennis shoe/indoor shoe inspired shoes, honestly I don't understand why someone would want to purchase these as I see all of the ""alternatives"" as better choices. 

## ASICS Japan S (duh)
Would recommend looking into the ""Pro"" and ""Golf"" versions as these look closer

## Adidas Campus (seen in store)
These are basically the same as the Japan S, but minus the stripes.

**Pros**

- gum rubber outsole, eva/rubber midsole

- muted retro colors

**Cons**

- chunkier look, bigger footprint for sure

## Honorable Mention
**Samba OG** with the full rubber bottom, honestly your best bet for GSMs would be to look at all of the models and try to see which has a top material and outsole that mathces. **Nike Field General** have a soft suede look and seem light, and could also sub in for a tokuten

# Tokuten

These are sambas

## Samba OG with Dark Gum Bottoms (owned)

Do I even need to explain? Hell I think the Samba ADVs might even be the better choice (lower profile bc of toe reinforcement and better materials). I've always been more of a Gazelle guy myself, but you should get these. See, not a Samba hater, I just never understood why someone would tell someone else who wants Mexico 66 to get a shoe that's completely different.

## Honorable Mention
**Nike Killshots**, some models of **Skyhand OG**, **Vans Authentic** though I really don't recommend Vans, anecdotally their shoes have really lost a lot of quality, I went from owning a pair that lasted me through high school to a pair not even lasting 10 months.

# EDR 78

Lightweight trail runner shoes, these are genuinely some of my most favorite pair of shoes, and like the Mexico 66 I couldn't really find another shoe like it. Finding shoes that match the outsole and retro styling isn't too hard, but its that super lightweight upper material and arch support that makes me love these

## ASICS Tiger Runner 2

Fitting that the closest I could find is ASICS, however these feel like a chunkier cross between the EDR 78 and California 78

**Pros**

- similar mid sole/outsole construction

- similar color ways

- somewhat same shape, though I would say closer to the California 78

**Cons**

- Noticeably taller silhouette 

- much thicker top material

## Adidas Country 2 (own) 

[Comparison pics](https://imgur.com/a/D7GF3Py) I was looking at these as EDR alternatives before I ended up just pulling the trigger on EDRs. I still got these and I do like them, but since I have the EDR I'm likely going to return my Country 2. Also it looks like they're phasing these out so **Country OG**s are the next best option, and Country OG have a lot more color ways and is sold as unisex. I have also tried these on and liked them, they feel like a cross between SL 72s and EDR 78s.

**Pros**

- almost identical shape and build

- EVA / rubber mid and bottom sole (lacking the trail spikes)

**Cons**

- lacking the arch support of the EDR, not friendly to my feet

- much thicker top material, feels like almost double the weight

- noticeably taller heels

## Honorable Mentions
**Puma Easy Riders**, they seem a tad closer to California 78s but they got EVA midsole and rubber bottom sole so its probably a similar walk, and they have a nice vintage appeal to them.

# California 78 / Ally / Alliance A40

These shoes aren't similar in top or sole materials but I'm grouping them together because their alternatives can sub in for either one depending on the material/color. I prefer the California 78 as they seem to elevate above the typical Tennis/Runner shoe style.

## ASICS Lyte Classic

Cheap, easy to get, very similar I would say just get these if you want California 78s.

**Pros**

- very similar in shape but not in build

- similar muted colors

- the same stripes

- suede top, eva midsole, 

## Adidas Country OG

Already know my opinion on it, I think its heavier weight makes it better as a California than EDR swap in, but also the top materials are way off.

## Reebok Classic AZ (seen)

**Pros**

- lean also a bit towards EDR 78s

- retro styling and colors

- similar looking stripes

**Cons**

- thicker material

- only womens sizing

- wider shape but still form fitting

- the midsole is much thinner but it is EVA and the bottom sole is rubber

## Honorable Mentions
**Waffle Trainers** depending on the model and **PUMA Speedcats** which seem like a cross between California 78s and Mexico 66s, I know their light weight.

# Kinda Tier List
Basically vertical axis matches which model i think matches up the best, and horizontal is my ""ranking"" between the alternatives

WINDHORSE, AIREI has wrapped the ASICS Gel-Quantum Kinetic completely in khadi gauze, a fabric made without electricity in Eastern India. AIREl's Spring-Summer '24 collection WINDHORSE pays homage to unwavering dedication. It is an ode to the indomitable spirit that resides in us all. The Gel-Quantum Kinetics, representing perseverance, have been engulfed by the fragile gauze, only to be set aflame by AIREl one by one. Flames symbolize immersion in a noble cause, fabrics bearing scars, and challenges overcome.
Each shoebox is also wrapped inside the gauze, allowing the wearer to be a part of the process.

I thought very carefully on what I'll be using just because I need to wear some of my shoes that I kept in boxes. I have a weird/random taste in shoes, my friends say. But I love sneakers! I have too much. I hope my rotation keeps up for these few months even though it probably won't, but wear all your sneakers. Currently Asics has my heart if you can't tell. I don't gate keep because I am a huge advocate for buying stuff you like. I like to consider myself a niche hypebeast, even though I have never owned a Jordan/Nike shoe for over 1 month. I hate that there's no universal guide for shoe sizing, so I hope this helps slightly. 

Left Side Top to Bottom:

Asics Gel Lyte III Nippon Blue (TTS fits more snug for wide footers)

Yeezy 500s Utility Black (TTS; beater of the group and my favorite and only silhouette of Yeezys (I have the Supermoons too). My historic Pre-Covid shoe lol)

Asics x Kiko Gel Kiril (TTS needs to break in)

Asics Gel Kayano 14 Birch (TTS most comfy from the jump!)

Right Side Top to Bottom:

Asics x Andersson Bell Protoblast (Half Size Up!; comfy and bouncy like a high school basketball shoe)

Balenciaga Track Sandals (Half Size Down/Euro Size, fits weird on the top part. Atleast it has adjustable velcro straps. Very Chunky! Always need a sandal for rotation imo.)

New Balance x Aime Leon Dore (TTS has a weird footbed for my flat/wide feet, but super comfy! High top is also essential for rotation!)

I‚Äôm a woman with wide toebox and narrow heel who has been looking for comfortable shoes for travel for weeks now and I still haven‚Äôt found the shoe that fits me well. I‚Äôm thisclose to getting the Vomero but I noticed that the upper is tight on my foot as I need to lace it tight so my heel won‚Äôt slip. 

Me having a wide forefront or toebox with a narrow heel (with normal arch) is usually the reason I have a hard time looking for shoes that fit. When the toebox is tight and I size up the heel slips.

So far, I‚Äôve tried New Balance 530 (fits well but I find the midsole stiff), NB 327, 740, Allbirds Treerunners, Adidas Ultraboost, Adidas Terrex shoes, all the Skechers walk shoes, Vans Ultrarange, Vans MTE Crosspath, Vans Lowland, Nike Free Run, Nike v2k run, Nike P6000 (fits well but the sides are too stiff!), Merrell Morphlite, Asics 1130, Asics Gel Sonoma, NB 1030, Adizero, Merrell Agility, Puma Scene Progressive. I think I've tried almost of the shoes I can in the malls I went to lol. Almost all of these I have problem with heel slippage. 

I‚Äôm going to check Brooks Ghost soon but I‚Äôm not confident cos I‚Äôve tried their shoes before and I didn't find luck with the sizing.

asics,Nike Vomero 5 - Can‚Äôt decide between two sizes,"Hello! I‚Äôve been tirelessly looking for a comfortable walking shoe these past few days for an upcoming out of country trip and I‚Äôve decided to go for Nike Vomero 5. Even though it‚Äôs a bit expensive, I ended up really liking it because it‚Äôs most comfortable out of all of the shoes I tried that can act as a lifestyle shoe. I initially wanted an NB 530 but when I tried it again I realized the midsole is quite stiff which is quite opposite of Vomero which is soft all over but not too soft that it‚Äôs too cushy as it has a right amount of stability. 

I‚Äôm just quite in a pickle over the sizing because I fell in love with the comfortability and softness of the size US8 but I have to tighten the laces up to the very last eyelet to make sure my heels don‚Äôt slip on my left foot (my smaller foot) which feels a bit tight on the bridge side (where the laces are tightened). I have a wide toebox and a narrow heel so I always have a problem with heel slippage and I‚Äôm always quite paranoid about it. 

When I tried the 7.5 size, I don‚Äôt have to tighten my laces on the bridge part of my foot that much but both shoes (L and R) feel tighter or snug on the toebox part or forefront of the shoe. The toecap allowance are fine though. The tightness isn‚Äôt painful, it‚Äôs just more snug but the size 7.5 doesn‚Äôt feel as cushy or soft as the size 8 because of that. The salesperson says that since the material is mesh, I can still give the 7.5 shoe time to expand over time and it won‚Äôt feel as snug anymore. 

What do you guys think? Do the Vomero 5 really soften over time? Will the 7.5 feel as cushy as the size 8 for me? When I do loosen up the laces a little bit on the left shoe of the size 8, there‚Äôs a bit of heel slippage. How much heel slippage is fine? Which size do you think is the better choice? I‚Äôm worried if I go with the smaller size, I won‚Äôt have the supposed cushiness and softness that I liked with the size 8. 

For reference, if it helps, I‚Äôm a size US 7 (23.5CM) Women with a Vans Old Skool, size 7 1/2 US women (24.5CM) with Asics Gel Kayano 30 Wide version Women‚Äôs, and size US 8 (24.5) on New Balance 530. All of these sizes have no problem with heel slippage and toebox space.

Vomero 5 Women size US7.5 is 24.5CM and the size US8 is 25CM. 

Thank you!

asics,Replaced my running sneaker,"So I had been wearing the **Adidas Ultraboost 22** for a little over **3 years** during which I‚Äôve run about **1500 KM or about 950 miles for my American peeps**. As a result of all the running my Ultraboost‚Äôs sole was worn out, which is why I had been looking to replace them for a while.

Yesterday I finally made a decision and picked **ASICS Nimbus 27 Luxe**.

This morning I did my first run in them 3 KM and I must say my Ultraboosts were not even to the Cushion on the Nimbus. If the Nimbus is a 10/10 then Ultraboost is 7/10.
(Cushion is extremely important for me since I‚Äôm recovering from fractured tibias in both my legs)

I knows it‚Äôs only been 1 days but I really recommend checking the Nimbus out at your local ASICS store. I suggest running on their in store treadmill to get a complete feel of how they suit your needs.

The price came out to be ‚Çπ16,750 and it was so worth it.

The other sneakers I was considering were:-On Cloudeclipse, New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 V14, Puma Magmax Nitro and Nike Invincible Run 3. 

P.S: I was also quite interested in On Cloudeclipse but it was being sold at 2x the price by resellers since the brand isn‚Äôt sold officially in my country.",5,4,2025-02-10 00:45:36,Sneakers
asics,When worlds collide‚Ä¶,"Of course I‚Äôm talking about Marvel, ASICS, and Kith coming together to make one of the dopest Super hero x Streetwear collabs ever in my opinion. I grew up always being a huge fan of Spider Man, and marvel in general(still got love for DC too). Spider man is one of those super heroes that you can‚Äôt help but relate to in one way or another, and you just want to see him succeed in life because he deserves it. Initially I grabbed this pack(resell), because I really wanted the Spider Man pair. Now that they‚Äôre both in hand, the Venom pair has really started to grow on me(possible symbiote joke?). The details they put into not only the shoes, but even the boxes and extras make it a really nice experience to unbox. Cool art on the plastic dust bags, a whole box sleeve with cover art, more art on both sides of the box to represent Spidey on one side, and Venom on the other. You also get three sets of extra laces for each pair, and a cool comic book to admire. 10/10 recommend these. Wore the Spideys all day yesterday and got nothing but compliments. Pair it with a nice AOP Spider Man tee and you‚Äôre good to go. üï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏è

asics,Sneaker shopping in Harajuku üáØüáµ,"Went sneaker shopping in Harajuku/Shibuya yesterday some random thoughts on what I saw, for the record I copped absolutely nothing as no shops had what I was looking for in a size12.

\-Yeezy 350hype in Tokyo is officially over once upon a time you could walk in Harajuku and see hundreds of people wearing 350s, thats dead..

\-asics gel 14 tax is unreal, this was a planned cop, visited the flagship asics store at the takehista dori intersection bottom of hill. They had 4 color ways only one (white color way) the tai chi... largest size was 9.5 US. Saw another shop on Cat St selling the Gel14 cream for like ¬•40,000 didn't even bother to ask for my size. Should've copped these on Goat before my trip.

\-Dunk low hype is over as well, you still see them on feet but every store is stocked from all the ABC marts and I mean all of them to resell shops to Nike flagship in Omotesando. Panda hype is dead dead.

\-Off white dunk lows(new) can be had for under $300 USD saw a few color ways for Ôø•51,000 with 20% off sticker along with tax free, some shop on Cat St

\-New balance is charging hard at least in Japan they've been gaining traction for 3yrs I'd say and lots of people rocking Asics for sure.

  
\- Travis Scott sneakers seem to be the new Yeezy within Tokyo lots of people gravitating to his sneakers at these shops, SB dunks(bright color ways) gaining some traction  

In closing no cops hitting up Ginza today if I see anything worth adding I will. Disclaimer: I lived in Japan for 4 years and visit frequently for work, my opinion on the sneaker vibe and hype is solely mine ",3,1,2025-01-24 14:40:51,Sneakers

It feels like it pushes into my big toe, and I'll push on the top and bottom of it to make it disappear (pic 3) and that helps for a bit, then it comes right back. Is there some kind of inner shoe guard or some way to push it back out?

* **Concerns:** My current Nike Air Max 90s start hurting my feet after a few hours. I need something durable that‚Äôll last me a long time. I also want the shoes to look good, which is why I‚Äôm hesitant about brands like Hoka or On. Hoka still looks good but on...

   * **Asics:** Gel-Nimbus, Gel-Cumulus
   * **Nike:** Air Zoom Pegasus
   * **Brooks:** Ghost 15
   * **Saucony:** Triumph
   * **On**
   * **Hoka:** Clifton, Bondi

The  second time I went in, they recommended the extra wide. The first time I got fitted (a while back), they said just wide was fine. I have very wide, duck-like feet, so I went with their latest recommendation and got the extra wides.

They actually felt fine when I tried them on in the store. Comfortable enough that I went ahead and bought them. But once I started working out in them, my feet felt super fatigued and worn out after just half a mile. It‚Äôs even worse during my Orangetheory Fitness workouts, where I need shoes that can handle treadmill, floor, and weight room work.

I‚Äôve also tried using insoles with them, but they felt way too hard and didn‚Äôt help.

Before these, I was using a pair of Asics Gel Contend 4 shoes I bought five years ago ‚Äî they went on a long hiatus, but when I brought them back out, they still felt fine up until very recently. That‚Äôs what finally pushed me to get new shoes.

So now I‚Äôm wondering:

I like versatile sneakers that I could pair with casual tracksuits but also jeans and maybe even some slightly more formal slacks. If I won't find something that looks-wise looks versatile enough I am more than happy to just buy different pairs, that's no issue.

Main things that matter to me is that they're comfortable and BREATHABLE. I've had too many leather sneakers were my foot inside is just on fire, the socks are soaked from sweat at the end of the day. I recently had Adidas Breaknet and they were great for me looks-wise, but terrible in breathability and broke down pretty fast. They pride themselves now to make some recycled material shoes and no idea why that's so ""cool"" since a shoe can't last me a year. (thankfully got them on sale)

I have a narrow foot and a bit larger size (31 centimeters, or US 13, EU 47,5) and the size is what usually forces me to be very limited in terms of looks and colors in what's available. I wore lots of Nikes in the past and like them and always had them for a while, but now people are saying that the quality is getting bad. Is New Balance really the hype? Because they're slowly reeling me in to trying them.

990v3s are the logical choice but are fairly limited as they‚Äôre a bit outdated now. Plus, most colours I‚Äôm not a huge fan of.

So in short, I‚Äôm looking for a pair of shoes I can do anything in. I might need to walk up a hill, walk around town all day, run for the train etc etc.

I like things with some ventilation as my feet get hot, so straight leather shoes (like most adidas) are sadly out. However I‚Äôm not a huge fan of how running shoes look, and wouldn‚Äôt like to wear them every day.

The prime candidates at the moment are the Nike GPS and New Balance 574. I‚Äôd love to hear any other recommendations from you!

Considering picking these up for the summer, however I am unsure of the sizing. I have heard I should go TTS, but I'm not sure whether my TTS is 7.5 or 8.

I wear a 7.5 in adidas gazelles, 8 in Air max 90, adidas samba and pretty much any new balance or asics. I also fit a GR AJ1 low, fit at 7.5, slightly narrow but nothing that breaking them in couldn't fix, wouldn't want it any longer as that length was perfect.

I like the thumb's width space in the front and not absolutely pressing my toes, I don't mind having to break them in.

Should I pick up a 7.5 or an 8?  
I can't really pick up both, as I'd have to pay a lot extra for sending one pair back.

Btw: I want to order them from footdistrict as they have fairly low shipping costs. Are they legit?

I just got the Nike P 6000 (last photo) and I like the style too. I was kind of hoping the tongue would be sewn down or at least more secure so it wouldn‚Äôt slide like the 530s. I haven‚Äôt worn them yet so I‚Äôm curious if anyone who owns them has the same issue with the tongue moving around.

Also, is there even a shoe that looks similar but actually has the tongue sewn in? I haven‚Äôt been able to find one that has the same kind of look but with that feature. Open to any suggestions or tips. Thanks in advance.",1,3,2025-04-16 16:56:48,Sneakers
new balance,Computational Design in Footwear Industry,"[Article on the adoption of computational design](https://cdfam.com/computational-advances-in-footwear-design/) in the footwear industry through the lens of upcoming CDFAM event in Amsterdam.

Some notes on computational approaches in footwear design presented at CDFAM Amsterdam.

Talks from On, Framas, and VivoBiome covered automated robotic fabrication, scan-to-print mass customization, and the use of generative design in traditional mold-making workflows.

Also referenced were earlier CDFAM presentations from Adidas, Carbon, New Balance, and others on lattice design, AI optimization, and scaling production pipelines.

new balance,Sneaker tarrifs,"Hey guys, I‚Äôve done some quick research on how tariffs work, Nike product costs, and the actual extra costs for Nike to import sneakers.

To begin with, I want to talk about the Jordan 1 High. This sneaker costs around $16 to produce. That‚Äôs for a basic version like the recent Black Toe Reimagined.  
Let‚Äôs say the box, with paper and everything, costs around $1 (the actual cost is usually around 50‚Äì70 cents depending on the box, while a special box like the Nigel Sylvester's costs around 70‚Äì80 cents).

So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs $17 total for the sneakers and the box.

Also, imagine we‚Äôre importing 1,000 pairs to keep the calculations simple.

---

**The sneakers: $17,000**  
Processing fee: ~$58.89  
Customs broker fee: between $100‚Äì$150, so let‚Äôs say $125  
Harbor fee: $21.25  
**Total import fees: $205.14**

Per pair, that‚Äôs only about **$0.21**, making the total cost around **$17.21**.

With tariffs, an extra 35% on the $17,000 cost from China would be **$5,950**.  
With these extra costs, the sneakers now cost **$23.16** each ‚Äî that‚Äôs **$5.95 more** per pair.

What Nike has to do to cover that $5.95 actually ends up costing way more than just the base price ‚Äî they also have to cover the cost of unsold sneakers. But Nike knows pushing sneaker prices too much won‚Äôt work, because New Balance is gonna dominate the market if they do.

With all of this in mind, I‚Äôm expecting Nike sneakers to go up around **$10**.

But the same goes for Adidas, Puma, etc. ‚Äî except New Balance, since they can just produce more USA-made.",4,36,2025-04-06 15:48:40,Sneakers

I thought very carefully on what I'll be using just because I need to wear some of my shoes that I kept in boxes. I have a weird/random taste in shoes, my friends say. But I love sneakers! I have too much. I hope my rotation keeps up for these few months even though it probably won't, but wear all your sneakers. Currently Asics has my heart if you can't tell. I don't gate keep because I am a huge advocate for buying stuff you like. I like to consider myself a niche hypebeast, even though I have never owned a Jordan/Nike shoe for over 1 month. I hate that there's no universal guide for shoe sizing, so I hope this helps slightly. 

Left Side Top to Bottom:

Asics Gel Lyte III Nippon Blue (TTS fits more snug for wide footers)

Yeezy 500s Utility Black (TTS; beater of the group and my favorite and only silhouette of Yeezys (I have the Supermoons too). My historic Pre-Covid shoe lol)

Asics x Kiko Gel Kiril (TTS needs to break in)

Asics Gel Kayano 14 Birch (TTS most comfy from the jump!)

Right Side Top to Bottom:

Asics x Andersson Bell Protoblast (Half Size Up!; comfy and bouncy like a high school basketball shoe)

Balenciaga Track Sandals (Half Size Down/Euro Size, fits weird on the top part. Atleast it has adjustable velcro straps. Very Chunky! Always need a sandal for rotation imo.)

First is the Patrick Iris. This is a shoe made in Japan that I purchased during a business trip(also available online). They are comfortable and amazing for those who enjoy driving due to the rounded heel. 

Next is the New Balance 990 Made in the USA. They are comfortable and incredibly durable. I will always have a pair of these in my rotation. I have worn them in 100 degree desert weather and shoveling light snow. Absolutely amazing shoes.

I‚Äôm a woman with wide toebox and narrow heel who has been looking for comfortable shoes for travel for weeks now and I still haven‚Äôt found the shoe that fits me well. I‚Äôm thisclose to getting the Vomero but I noticed that the upper is tight on my foot as I need to lace it tight so my heel won‚Äôt slip. 

Me having a wide forefront or toebox with a narrow heel (with normal arch) is usually the reason I have a hard time looking for shoes that fit. When the toebox is tight and I size up the heel slips.

So far, I‚Äôve tried New Balance 530 (fits well but I find the midsole stiff), NB 327, 740, Allbirds Treerunners, Adidas Ultraboost, Adidas Terrex shoes, all the Skechers walk shoes, Vans Ultrarange, Vans MTE Crosspath, Vans Lowland, Nike Free Run, Nike v2k run, Nike P6000 (fits well but the sides are too stiff!), Merrell Morphlite, Asics 1130, Asics Gel Sonoma, NB 1030, Adizero, Merrell Agility, Puma Scene Progressive. I think I've tried almost of the shoes I can in the malls I went to lol. Almost all of these I have problem with heel slippage. 

I‚Äôm going to check Brooks Ghost soon but I‚Äôm not confident cos I‚Äôve tried their shoes before and I didn't find luck with the sizing.

new balance,Nike Vomero 5 - Can‚Äôt decide between two sizes,"Hello! I‚Äôve been tirelessly looking for a comfortable walking shoe these past few days for an upcoming out of country trip and I‚Äôve decided to go for Nike Vomero 5. Even though it‚Äôs a bit expensive, I ended up really liking it because it‚Äôs most comfortable out of all of the shoes I tried that can act as a lifestyle shoe. I initially wanted an NB 530 but when I tried it again I realized the midsole is quite stiff which is quite opposite of Vomero which is soft all over but not too soft that it‚Äôs too cushy as it has a right amount of stability. 

I‚Äôm just quite in a pickle over the sizing because I fell in love with the comfortability and softness of the size US8 but I have to tighten the laces up to the very last eyelet to make sure my heels don‚Äôt slip on my left foot (my smaller foot) which feels a bit tight on the bridge side (where the laces are tightened). I have a wide toebox and a narrow heel so I always have a problem with heel slippage and I‚Äôm always quite paranoid about it. 

When I tried the 7.5 size, I don‚Äôt have to tighten my laces on the bridge part of my foot that much but both shoes (L and R) feel tighter or snug on the toebox part or forefront of the shoe. The toecap allowance are fine though. The tightness isn‚Äôt painful, it‚Äôs just more snug but the size 7.5 doesn‚Äôt feel as cushy or soft as the size 8 because of that. The salesperson says that since the material is mesh, I can still give the 7.5 shoe time to expand over time and it won‚Äôt feel as snug anymore. 

What do you guys think? Do the Vomero 5 really soften over time? Will the 7.5 feel as cushy as the size 8 for me? When I do loosen up the laces a little bit on the left shoe of the size 8, there‚Äôs a bit of heel slippage. How much heel slippage is fine? Which size do you think is the better choice? I‚Äôm worried if I go with the smaller size, I won‚Äôt have the supposed cushiness and softness that I liked with the size 8. 

For reference, if it helps, I‚Äôm a size US 7 (23.5CM) Women with a Vans Old Skool, size 7 1/2 US women (24.5CM) with Asics Gel Kayano 30 Wide version Women‚Äôs, and size US 8 (24.5) on New Balance 530. All of these sizes have no problem with heel slippage and toebox space.

Vomero 5 Women size US7.5 is 24.5CM and the size US8 is 25CM. 

Thank you!

As a result of all the running my Ultraboost‚Äôs sole was worn out, which is why I had been looking to replace them for a while.

Yesterday I finally made a decision and picked **ASICS Nimbus 27 Luxe**.

This morning I did my first run in them 3 KM and I must say my Ultraboosts were not even to the Cushion on the Nimbus. If the Nimbus is a 10/10 then Ultraboost is 7/10.
(Cushion is extremely important for me since I‚Äôm recovering from fractured tibias in both my legs)

I knows it‚Äôs only been 1 days but I really recommend checking the Nimbus out at your local ASICS store. I suggest running on their in store treadmill to get a complete feel of how they suit your needs.

The price came out to be ‚Çπ16,750 and it was so worth it.

new balance,New Balance Fresh Foam vs Skechers Max Cushioning,"I love the marshmallowy feel of New Balance Fresh Foam. I have purchased 3 pairs and most of my immediate family agree and own a pair or two each. My wife and I are getting older (50's) and we get sore backs, knees etc from walking for exercise and just doing errands, going to the store etc. Fresh foam seems to help a lot.  
  
Both of my daughters are young but have jobs that keep them walking their entire shift. Both of my daughters love Fresh foam and say they make it much easier to get through their shifts.  
  
I have recently been curious about Skechers Max Cushioning for several reasons. I'm embarrassed to admit that I love the idea of slip ons. I guess it just makes me feel like the super old guy that moves to Velcro shoes because her can no longer tie his shoes.  
  
I have a pair of older Skechers slip ons which are not particularly comfortable in comparison to my New Balance but I keep grabbing them because they are just easier to put on and off.  
  
I thought hmmm what if I could get slip ons that were as comfortable or even close to the comfort of my New Balance.  
  
Skechers even has water resistant sneakers now. Damn, if I could get water resistant on top of comfort and slip ons!  
  
Has anyone here owned both New Balance Fresh Foam and the new Skechers Max Cushioning? How do you think they compare comfort and cushion wise? Which version of FreshFoam did you own? I think the version of Fresh Foam makes a difference.  
  
One last reason I'm looking at Skechers is because in my opinion, the latest versions of FreshFoam just look stupid. Looks like your walking on crazy tall platforms or something. My first pair looked awesome, my last pair FreshFoam X are just too big and wide on the bottom and although stable, I feel like I'm wearing big floppy clown shoes.  

Update: I went to the Skechers Outlet Store and tried the Max Cushion on and walked around for a bit. I had my New Balance Fresh Foam X on one foot and the Skechers Max Cushion on the other. NOT even a comparison really, no competition at all. Skechers literally felt like I was walking on a piece of hard wood compared to the pillow softness of the New Balance. Sadly I wanted to love the Skechers but just don‚Äôt get why anyone would choose these over the New Balance Fresh Foam X if what you‚Äôre looking for is cushion.",2,0,2025-02-01 09:28:06,Sneakers

new balance,Please help!  Going to Japan next Friday and had lower back pain the last time I went...,"Hi all,  
For context, I weight train every day and I love to do cardio and can usually run forever, so walking is no problem.  I'm leaving to Japan soon and I have a deep anxiety related to the lower back pain I got the last time I was there (3 months ago).  I was pushing 30-40k steps) and I developed a terrible lower back pain on my second or third day wearing **New Balance 1906.**  I was looking for a balance in fashion and comfort and I figured a sporty shoe should be perfect for walking comfort. 

After the 3rd day, I couldn't walk 1000 steps before my lower back pain would kick in.  I left my backpack at home, I tried stiffening my core, pointing my chest to the sky, and even buying Hoka Clifton 9s midway through the trip but the damage had already been done.  It did help a bit, but it would still kick in.

I purchased Nike Vomero 5s and after walking around in office, I notice that the heel box is really stiff similar to the 1906s.  I really fear that may be why my lower back pain is activated, or since I usually wear flat shoes, the heel to toe drop is throwing my alignment out of wack.

  Does anyone have a recommendation on what to do before I leave? ",0,2,2025-01-24 14:44:21,Sneakers
new balance,Sneaker shopping in Harajuku üáØüáµ,"Went sneaker shopping in Harajuku/Shibuya yesterday some random thoughts on what I saw, for the record I copped absolutely nothing as no shops had what I was looking for in a size12.

\-Yeezy 350hype in Tokyo is officially over once upon a time you could walk in Harajuku and see hundreds of people wearing 350s, thats dead..

\-asics gel 14 tax is unreal, this was a planned cop, visited the flagship asics store at the takehista dori intersection bottom of hill. They had 4 color ways only one (white color way) the tai chi... largest size was 9.5 US. Saw another shop on Cat St selling the Gel14 cream for like ¬•40,000 didn't even bother to ask for my size. Should've copped these on Goat before my trip.

\-Dunk low hype is over as well, you still see them on feet but every store is stocked from all the ABC marts and I mean all of them to resell shops to Nike flagship in Omotesando. Panda hype is dead dead.

\-Off white dunk lows(new) can be had for under $300 USD saw a few color ways for Ôø•51,000 with 20% off sticker along with tax free, some shop on Cat St

\-New balance is charging hard at least in Japan they've been gaining traction for 3yrs I'd say and lots of people rocking Asics for sure.

  
\- Travis Scott sneakers seem to be the new Yeezy within Tokyo lots of people gravitating to his sneakers at these shops, SB dunks(bright color ways) gaining some traction  

In closing no cops hitting up Ginza today if I see anything worth adding I will. Disclaimer: I lived in Japan for 4 years and visit frequently for work, my opinion on the sneaker vibe and hype is solely mine ",4,1,2025-01-24 14:40:51,Sneakers

new balance,Nike Vomero 5 - Smoke Grey new premium materials,"Just got this pair of the new Nike Vomero 5 Smoke Grey. I bought them because I noticed they were $10 more ($170) than other Vomero 5s and looked different (mesh, Nike swoosh, lining, etc.)

**Note these are not the laces they came with, but I had some perfect matches of Dunk laces lying around and liked how these looked*

I fully planned to send them back if they didn't wow me, but I gotta say, I am very impressed! The QC for Nike is always rough, so that besides the point, the materials are a big upgrade over regular Vomero 5s. 

- The mesh on the toe box and tongue are much tighter weave and of higher quality while remaining breathable. The internal liner is the same. 

- the heel and foot area around the foot hole are LESS padded than other Vomero 5s, however they are lined with a much nicer/smoother suede (peach color). 

- the exterior of the heel is wrapped in leather that feels really smooth 

- the swoosh is the same leather material, and stitched on without a white outline 

- the panels are ALL leather/suede. No plastics. It feels far more premium and ""buttery"" smooth. 

- the fit is LONGER than other Vomero 5s. I have 9.5 in regular Vomero 5s and these and these fit so much better, even a little big! My toes have room to spare, vs the normal Vomeros my toes are touching the end of the shoe. 9.5 is my usual TTS. 

- the Nike Vomero tag on the tongue is also a smooth leather, not cloth 

- mid and outsoles remains the same 

Overall, this feels more like a New Balance shoe in its materials than a Vomero 5, and I am not mad about that at all. The materials feel and look a lot more premium, while maintaining the same comfort and making the shoe fit better/longer. Plus this colorway is easy to style with anything, which is what I wanted. 

Idk why Nike hasn't really mentioned any differences here and just quietly launched these.  ",73,13,2025-01-17 09:30:30,Sneakers

Safari SBs for our kids since we already had our own, so we all matched for Christmas Day.

For me:
Jbalvin Jordan‚Äôs which are way outside of our acceptable budget

Futuras: I gave my wife a pair which was her top shoe, then the next gift was her surprising me with a pair! It was pretty fun!

What the prods: wasn‚Äôt on my wife‚Äôs bucket list but knew she would love them. I had a bunch of the OG prods so had to educate her for when someone says something lol

Escargot my kids picked out at an outlet for her

adidas samba,Killshot 2 vs Samba OG vs Torkuten,"Hi everyone 

I need to finalise on a pair of shoes for summer and am struggling to decide on the best one for long term use. I really like the combination of white/birch base on navy/black and the gum sole and have shortlisted these 3 pairs. 

Here‚Äôs the reasons for the dilemma.  

Killshot 2 - tried on size 10 and it was a
Good fit. But the issue is that it feels cheap especially the leather and I‚Äôm not sure how it will last. Didn‚Äôt feel as comfortable as I thought and concerned about durability. 

Sambas OG - sized up as recommended and the 10.5 fitted really well. Have concerns about how long they will last as the leather feels same to the Killshot. 

Torkuten - love the leather and design. The problem is that there is a little more room at the toe box coz of wide feet than I would like and it‚Äôs bound to lead to heavy creases. Size 10 is the best fit and the only option is to wear thicker socks and use crease protectors when the shoes are resting.

Price wise - Nike and Samba‚Äôs are evenly priced but the Tokuten means ¬£60 more. 

Trend - everyone says the Tigers are way cooler than the rest and although it‚Äôs not the main requirement I would like to avoid being a cliche. 

I did try the adidas court 3 shoes in the same colour option but they were really heavy. 

Would love to know everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this. 

Thanks ",2,0,2025-04-25 09:28:05,Sneakers
adidas samba,AJ1 Low '85 Sizing,"https://preview.redd.it/uxfxvo5r4kwe1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=481f12296d213d646d2a491d54d29742a7a5c704

Considering picking these up for the summer, however I am unsure of the sizing. I have heard I should go TTS, but I'm not sure whether my TTS is 7.5 or 8.

I wear a 7.5 in adidas gazelles, 8 in Air max 90, adidas samba and pretty much any new balance or asics. I also fit a GR AJ1 low, fit at 7.5, slightly narrow but nothing that breaking them in couldn't fix, wouldn't want it any longer as that length was perfect.

I like the thumb's width space in the front and not absolutely pressing my toes, I don't mind having to break them in.

Should I pick up a 7.5 or an 8?  
I can't really pick up both, as I'd have to pay a lot extra for sending one pair back.

Btw: I want to order them from footdistrict as they have fairly low shipping costs. Are they legit?

Edit: I specifically want to avoid going to big because it can cause weird creasing. (not just regular creasing, nothing wrong with that)",1,12,2025-04-23 03:01:19,Sneakers
adidas samba,Need help with sizing,"Hey lads,

I'm a relatively new sneaker head and looking to increase my collection. Never really bought shoes online or bought them frequently, hence i barely know my size. The only brand of sneakers I got was Adidas and mostly received running shoes and recently football shoes, which are size 10. I'm 100% that size 10 (mens) is my adidas size as I recently copped a pair of Samba XLGs (black and white with gum) and those fit perfectly.

However, in terms of Nike, I got a pair of Air Force 1 Lv8s - Cannon Rust with the snakeskin pattern (which were quite huge in the toe box, me being unaware of AF1s running large than normal Nike sneakers. I somehow managed to resolve the situation by adding an insole, which i really didnt want but dont mind cause i really like the shoe.

Currently I'm looking to cop the Air Jordan 1 low ""Cranes"" by Rui Hachimura, and I dont know what size i should go for. Based on what I've measured and identified, I'd fit a size 10 but I'm still not confident and keep overthinking, cause i dont wanna make the same mistake as i did before and order the wrong size. 

My foot size is around 26.3 ish to around 27 roughly (right foot measured only), and I have relatively wide feet, hence adidas size 10 fits well with just enough room.

Hope to not be a burden on this community, would really love some advice and insight from all Sneakerheads, which I hope to become someday. <3",0,2,2025-04-19 09:42:32,Sneakers

adidas samba,Ultimate(ish) Guide to Onitsuka Tiger Alternatives,"So tigers are definitely getting popular, they're also difficult or expensive to get your hands on and I've noticed a decent amount of threads/in person conversations where people ask what are good alternatives - and usually the answer is *Sambas* which has always pissed me off because there are other alternatives **by adidas** that I think better emulate the form and it just feels like a copout answer.

Like many recent young professionals I had the privilege of being able to vacation in Japan for a bit and I also had the privilege of buying (and falling in love) with my first pair of Onitsuka Tigers, the classic Mexico 66 SD. While I was there I also really wanted to get a pair of EDR 78 but couldn't bring it along and they weren't available on the online store for another few months (and when they did become available I had to shell out almost $180 and got extremely lucky it was in my size). So I've been looking at shoes that achieve similar goals and here's my findings.

### What makes Tigers Special
This is gonna be different for everyone, I've heard people say that its the stripes (which never made sense to me???) but for me it's: lightweight thin materials, unique silhouette, (literal) small footprint, muted colors, and good arch support (I'm flat footed). I love the retro, athletic inspired, designs. So this is what I'll be focusing on for the comparison. Also I understand the reluctance to drop so much money on a pair of shoes you can't try on (which generally run a bit small but kinda stretch to your size, I'd recommend just dropping about half you're normal size or get your normal size)

### Qualification for Alternatives
So obviously I'd like them to match the aforementioned features, but outside of that this is a guide primarily focused on **US domestic market** with recent availability (so no Nike drops or whatever they're calling them now). Focus on cost too, if the shoes are >$150 at that point you really should just buy the real thing. Most of these shoes I've seen in person, tried, or bought, which I will mention. And for those I haven't as I shop around I'll try to remember to come back and update this, and do mention any you recommend.

# Mexico 66/66 SD
Starting off with the hard one, because there's really no shoe like it. This is absolutely one where I recommend buying off the site or used. With that said, I think what's going for this model is its lightweight materials and unique silhouette

## Adidas SL 72 (tried on)
these are my go to alternatives as most of the outfits where I feel like my Mexico 66 shine, it could easily swap in 

**Pros**

- genuinely shocked me with how much it looked like the tigers I was wearing (granted they were womens' sized)

- similar silhouette 

- similar color schemes

- eva midsole + rubber spiked bottom, similar walking feel, Tigers are spikier lol don't walk on carpet with them


**Cons**

- mostly being sold in women sizes, definitely recommend going in store to size them

- thicker top material

- look somewhat like a cross between Mexico 66 and EDR 78

## Adidas Japan Shoes (seen in person)
**Pros**
- lightweight material 

- unique silhouette 

- rubber outsole

**Cons**

- not the same silhouette as Mexico 66

- two color options

## Adidas Samba 62 (seen in person, see I'm not a Sambas hater)
These aren't Mexico 66 however, due to their unique, retro sneaker look and the fact that they come from the same era of shoes, means I do recommend these as ""pinch hitters"" so to speak. Definitely get them on sale tho. These, the Japan Shoes, and Mexico 66 are all retro track inspired shoes that will make people turn their heads, and at the end of the day isn't that what this is all about

**Pros**

- lightweight material

- rubber outsole

**Cons**

- disimilar silhouette 

- one color

- thicker top material, but not as thick as Samba OG

## Honorable Mentions
**Adidas R71s/Dragons**, can't seem to get my hands on them in the US but they're pretty cheap and similar to the SL 72s, if anyone else wants to throw their hat in on this. I also saw [these](https://imgur.com/a/9KBbxIW) **Reebok Campio XT** which did look similar from the top and side (from a distance) but they have a different silhouette, however the Reebok white stripes do evoke the Asics stripes and if two people were wearing both shoes and quickly walked past me I don't think I could tell the difference. Plus at Journey's they were $40.

# Serrano
Thin soled like the Mexico 66 and carrying over features of the same unique silhouette but featuring a thicker top material (suede, leather, polyester) and more cushioning.

## ASICS Skyhand OG
yeah this one is pretty easy, you get basically everything, including the stripes, I've seen these go as low as $50. I don't see any reason to look for anything else. I saw a thread that recommended Nike Waffle Trainer 2, but the only models of that shoe that look similar are from their limited release SNKRS platform so didn't include them.

**Cons**

- much thicker outsole

# Mexico 66 Delegation

Thick comfort focused outsole versions of the Mexico 66, I don't remember seeing these in Japan but they look very similar to the GSM 
## ASICS Japan S
Again, easy choice, but this does come down on which color way you're looking at. For my example I chose the black cream, but the stitching on the outsole does look a lot like the GSM. I believe these look more like the Mexico 66 Delegation than the GSM, but these do look a lot like the GSM.

# GSM

Tennis shoe/indoor shoe inspired shoes, honestly I don't understand why someone would want to purchase these as I see all of the ""alternatives"" as better choices. 

## ASICS Japan S (duh)
Would recommend looking into the ""Pro"" and ""Golf"" versions as these look closer

## Adidas Campus (seen in store)
These are basically the same as the Japan S, but minus the stripes.

**Pros**

- gum rubber outsole, eva/rubber midsole

- muted retro colors

**Cons**

- chunkier look, bigger footprint for sure

## Honorable Mention
**Samba OG** with the full rubber bottom, honestly your best bet for GSMs would be to look at all of the models and try to see which has a top material and outsole that mathces. **Nike Field General** have a soft suede look and seem light, and could also sub in for a tokuten

# Tokuten

These are sambas

## Samba OG with Dark Gum Bottoms (owned)

Do I even need to explain? Hell I think the Samba ADVs might even be the better choice (lower profile bc of toe reinforcement and better materials). I've always been more of a Gazelle guy myself, but you should get these. See, not a Samba hater, I just never understood why someone would tell someone else who wants Mexico 66 to get a shoe that's completely different.

## Honorable Mention
**Nike Killshots**, some models of **Skyhand OG**, **Vans Authentic** though I really don't recommend Vans, anecdotally their shoes have really lost a lot of quality, I went from owning a pair that lasted me through high school to a pair not even lasting 10 months.

# EDR 78

Lightweight trail runner shoes, these are genuinely some of my most favorite pair of shoes, and like the Mexico 66 I couldn't really find another shoe like it. Finding shoes that match the outsole and retro styling isn't too hard, but its that super lightweight upper material and arch support that makes me love these

## ASICS Tiger Runner 2

Fitting that the closest I could find is ASICS, however these feel like a chunkier cross between the EDR 78 and California 78

**Pros**

- similar mid sole/outsole construction

- similar color ways

- somewhat same shape, though I would say closer to the California 78

**Cons**

- Noticeably taller silhouette 

- much thicker top material

## Adidas Country 2 (own) 

[Comparison pics](https://imgur.com/a/D7GF3Py) I was looking at these as EDR alternatives before I ended up just pulling the trigger on EDRs. I still got these and I do like them, but since I have the EDR I'm likely going to return my Country 2. Also it looks like they're phasing these out so **Country OG**s are the next best option, and Country OG have a lot more color ways and is sold as unisex. I have also tried these on and liked them, they feel like a cross between SL 72s and EDR 78s.

**Pros**

- almost identical shape and build

- EVA / rubber mid and bottom sole (lacking the trail spikes)

**Cons**

- lacking the arch support of the EDR, not friendly to my feet

- much thicker top material, feels like almost double the weight

- noticeably taller heels

## Honorable Mentions
**Puma Easy Riders**, they seem a tad closer to California 78s but they got EVA midsole and rubber bottom sole so its probably a similar walk, and they have a nice vintage appeal to them.

# California 78 / Ally / Alliance A40

These shoes aren't similar in top or sole materials but I'm grouping them together because their alternatives can sub in for either one depending on the material/color. I prefer the California 78 as they seem to elevate above the typical Tennis/Runner shoe style.

## ASICS Lyte Classic

Cheap, easy to get, very similar I would say just get these if you want California 78s.

**Pros**

- very similar in shape but not in build

- similar muted colors

- the same stripes

- suede top, eva midsole, 

## Adidas Country OG

Already know my opinion on it, I think its heavier weight makes it better as a California than EDR swap in, but also the top materials are way off.

## Reebok Classic AZ (seen)

**Pros**

- lean also a bit towards EDR 78s

- retro styling and colors

- similar looking stripes

**Cons**

- thicker material

- only womens sizing

- wider shape but still form fitting

- the midsole is much thinner but it is EVA and the bottom sole is rubber

## Honorable Mentions
**Waffle Trainers** depending on the model and **PUMA Speedcats** which seem like a cross between California 78s and Mexico 66s, I know their light weight.

# Kinda Tier List
Basically vertical axis matches which model i think matches up the best, and horizontal is my ""ranking"" between the alternatives

So i wanted 2 pairs of dress sneakers that i could wear when i didnt need to wear the docs.  1 White, 1 black.

I went to the outlet mall this Saturday, tried on Adidas Gazelles, and Sambas, Nike Killshot, and a Leather puma. I have never thought that I had wide feet but every single show like that looks like it was meant for someone whos foot was about an inch narrower than mine. 

I ended up buying a pair of Puma Court Classic Vulc FS (Which is canvas i guess) but white and look nice.

adidas samba,I wish Onitsuka Tiger shoes were suitable for walking‚Ä¶ üò≠,"‚Ä¶but this part of the outsole is just not durable. I even brought it to a shoemaker to add some hard rubber before the dark blue outsole got worn, but it didn‚Äôt work so well.

Their SD model is more comfortable for walking, but WAY TOO NARROW!! And the pattern of wear of the outsole is the same, which is super ugly btw, on top of reducing the lifespan of the shoes

Not a fan of the Adidas Samba, nor the Pumas, nor the Nike Cortez.

Any ideas? 

Wifey said ‚Äújust go around with your pair of walking shoes (Nike Pegasus for me), get them out of your backpack when you have to walk, and switch to your Onitsuka when you need more dressy‚Äù, but not very convenient to always go around with two pairs of shoes lol.",0,6,2024-12-21 12:04:50,Sneakers

adidas samba,"What ""athleisure"" shoe (that isn't the NB 990s) is the best for whole days of walking 20-25k steps? ","I'm not sure how you folks feel about the term ""athleisure"" but for a definition of terms specific for this post, I'd describe it as a type of shoe that sits midway between ""lifestyle sneakers"" and ""running shoes""

When I say lifestyle sneakers, these are your casual going out footwear like the Adidas Sambas, Nike AF1s, Dunks or Chucks. 

When I say running shoes, I mean those like the NB Fuelcell, Nike Alphafly, and Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris. Those shoes that are actually built and engineered for serious distance/speed training and running.

So when I think ""athleisure"" I'm thinking they're closer to the family of running shoes, but you would use them more in a leisurely manner than running. Specific models I'd say would be the NB 990s or most of the Made in USA collection. I feel like the Nike Vomeros would also fit in here.

Having said that, I'm trying to crowdsource what ""athleisure"" shoes are the most comfortable for entire days of walking 20-25k steps? 

But leave the NB 990s out of the conversation because I already have these and love em but am looking for other similar shoes that fit the bill. I'm actually thinking Vomeros but will wait for what comes out of this discussion. ",2,7,2024-11-04 01:10:10,Sneakers

Lanzera soccer boots and the indoor Jackal model were all over my home town in the mid 1990s. I wore the hell out of my pairs ‚Äì¬†I probably had 4 or 5 over the years. Kind of like a Samba with a super clean profile and soft toe box, all in suede (to the best of my knowledge). 

The company went out of business like 20 years ago (or at least stopped making shoes, I think maybe they still did soccer gear/gloves). But they're relaunching and have the Jackal back in stock in three colorways: Caramello (shown here), Navy/White, Black/White. 

Also happen to be killer driving shoes if you're into cars at all. I wrote up a review on that front for my blog: [https://carsfancy.com/lanzera-jackal-review-perfect-driving-shoe/](https://carsfancy.com/lanzera-jackal-review-perfect-driving-shoe/)

adidas samba,Shoes for Work?,"Hello. I'm a retail worker. Unfortunately, my particular workplace tends to run me rather ragged. For the past year or so, I've been rocking a pair of Adidas Sambas, and though I love them for most things, they don't give me the support I need for my work. I typically walk about a mile to-and-from work every day and then spend the entire day on my feet, walking and standing and carrying things with minimal time to rest. It's not fun; pain in my feet and my back has become a part of my life. However, recently, I accidentally tore off one of the laces on my Sambas and I've taken it as a sign to jump ship and look for greener pastures. On a busy day, I'll walk an average of \~7000 steps without sitting, so I need something that will be comfortable in these conditions and durable enough to survive; I'm pretty rough on my footwear (I've shredded several pairs of socks at the heels just from my daily routine) so I'm looking for something that could survive a small apocalypse.

adidas samba,WDYWT? Everything : A review of the 7 pairs of sneakers I've copped since starting this hobby.,"**When did this all start?**   
Last June, when I picked up the blue AM1s on sale, it's like a switch just flipped and I've been looking at sneakers everywhere.

**01 : Nike Air Max 1 - White/University Blue**

* STYLE : I love the university blue colorway, or just the UNC colorway in general and anything that looks like it. However, and I didn't feel like this at first, I'm growing less and less fond of the light grey mid panel area the more I wear the shoe. I finding myself wishing it were all white instead.
* COMFORT : Very snug, flexible, and well-cushioned. No complaints at all.
* SIZING : TTS. I'm a Size 12. The shoe is a size 12. It fits perfectly.

https://preview.redd.it/rzqumpownwjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36233ce43bb71db0ebbfcafa0dd56ec7947e7035

**02 : Nike Air Max 90 - Summit White/Monarch/Light Pumice/Light British Tan**

* STYLE : Absolutely adore everything about how this shoe looks. idk if anyone remembers, but when I first saw this shoe I posted here that it reminds me of BB-8 from Star Wars. It still does, and I love it. The silhouette also looks chunkier than the Air Max 1s and I prefer that.
* COMFORT : It doesn't only look chunkier, it also feels chunkier on the feet. That's not to say that it feels uncomfortably heavy, but you feel it more, if that makes sense. Still, very snug, and feels like it also has more cushion that the AM1s.
* SIZING : TTS. Perfect fit.

https://preview.redd.it/murxv981owjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9b076aa7a98d6622c05f44d2c28a912cbc18d5c

**03 : Nike Air Force 1 '07 LV8 - Coconut Milk/Bicoastal/Black/Vintage Green**

* STYLE : Classic. It has a silhouette and general style that goes well with almost anything, but you already know that. Now I know that. the rugged finish on the material of the shoe looks great and the bicoastal green paired with coconut milk looks like magic. I was totally enamored by the J3 x Nina Chanel collab but also new I would never get that. So when I saw this, it didn't take long for me to decide on buying it with pretty much the same colors.
* COMFORT : They are not comfortable. The perfect description for me would be: Stiff. I wear them to work. I'd wear them on nights out. I wouldn't wear them for anything that will involve long walks or buys days where I gotta move in and around lots of areas. Also, the laces that come with these seem really long. idk if that's the same for all AF1s but I'm thinking whether I should change them or not because while the color of the laces are perfect, the length makes them look a bit lousy.
* SIZING : I got Size 12 but they feel most comfortable with thick socks. I can see why people recommend going half a size down with these, but I also have wide feet so I took my chances with my regular size.

https://preview.redd.it/qiqtcgu3qwjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09384ecb842a99d073daa6ae4d163cb397dcf7b3

**04 : Nike Field General SP x Union - Ivory and Light Orewood Brown**

* STYLE : Honestly a tad bit loud for my taste/style. The guava version were the ones that initially caught my eye because they looked more muted and earth-toned, but the more I saw these, the more I preferred it over the guavas. My wife was super surprised that 1) I got these; and 2) I swapped the default white laces for the even louder yellow laces. Well I like it. Seems my style is evolving. It's just a bit hard to match with the right outfits, but sometimes I just mix and match and unless it feels completely off, I'll go with whatever. Also, the silhouette is sleek. They absolutely look like football shoes and the narrowness is more reminiscent of an Adidas Samba or Puma Palermo than most Nike shoes. I like how it adds variety to the collection and flexibility to my footwear.
* COMFORT : Light and comfortable. Not a lot of cushioning, but it doesn't really need it with the soft material. It's one of those shoes that you don't even notice they're there even after a significant amount of walking.
* SIZING : TTS. Perfect fit.

https://preview.redd.it/xljriif8swjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f39175bb37ffaa2035d12496a328ad13c10f323

**05 : Adidas Samba OG - White/Black**

* STYLE : The most classic and timeless sneaker you can have, imo. A silhouette that goes with anything and colors that will match with anything. It's a black and white Samba, I don't know what more needs to be said. Though I will add: I have wide feet and the Sambas are narrow. I'm not sure if that the reason, but I feel like the wear and tear shows faster on the Sambas than the Nike's I have. Or maybe I just wear them more often because they're an all-rounder.
* COMFORT : Average. I don't think I'd wear them, for, say, a 20-thousand step day during a vacation in Japan. But for most days you can't really go wrong with Sambas.
* SIZING : TTS. Good fit. Time will tell if my wide feet and the narrow build of the shoe will wreck havoc on the Sambas.

https://preview.redd.it/e83322leuwjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=823d04e9274f54442885d89b045da018f0445f88

**06 : Adidas Samba OG - Cream White / Preloved Brown / Wonder White**

* STYLE : Love the earth/muted tones on this. The cream white works magnificently. Overall a really cohesive colorway. The only thing that some might take issue with (though I don't) is that the body of the shoe is textile instead of leather which causes some parts of the shoe to look crumpled, which you can even already see on the photo below.
* COMFORT : More comfortable, light, flexible, and breathable that the leather sambas because of the textile lining.
* SIZING : TTS. Good fit. 

https://preview.redd.it/psonfh7l4xjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922532d38e6e98358a9f1e640e641a107f578934

**07 : Nike Air Jordan 1 High OG Denim**

* STYLE : I'm not a fan of high cuts, but sometimes you just get a feeling about a shoe, and I love the denim finish complete with the dye bleed effect into the light solid panels.
* COMFORT : Out of all my other shoes, this feels most similar to the AF1, which is to say it's not that comfortable. It feels generally stiff and not breathable. Also I'm still getting used to the high cut hugging above the ankles and touching the upper part of the heel/achilles while walking.
* SIZING : It feels like a loose fit if I got with my usual Size 12s. Again, similar in that way to the AF1s. Not sure if it's recommended for this shoe to go half a size down. Personally, I just wear thicker socks than usual.

https://preview.redd.it/xy8hk3oc5xjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29cd5766c02e047b759825c015cb4101f52d2997

  
----- BONUS CONTENT -----

I was just going to review the sneakers I bought since starting with the hobby/collection, but I thought I'd throw in my old sneakers for posterity's sake. These were my only two pairs of sneakers on rotation since 2022 until June 2024 when I started buying the pairs above.

----- BONUS CONTENT -----

**08 : Onitsuka Tiger Ultimate 81 - Burnt Olive / Glacier Grey**

* STYLE : I didn't care at the time, but I probably won't cop this if I saw it in a store now, lol.
* COMFORT : Among the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've ever had on my feet. Light, breathable, and can carry you through walking 30-thousand steps in Tokyo while on vacation. This pair has been through the trenches and I love em for that.
* SIZING : I buy 11.5 for Onitsukas and these fit like a glove on my Size 12 feet.

https://preview.redd.it/gn3qhnw9axjd1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87bf32a776915aa36ad90883bcb08f1ffc1c8276

**09 : Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 - Cream/Black**

* STYLE : I feel like these were my black and white Sambas before I got actual black and white Sambas. I like them and wore them with everything.
* COMFORT : The Onitsukas above are more comfortable but these aren't bad.
* SIZING : The 11.5s fit pretty well.

adidas samba,Got back into biking and picked up a pair of the Velo Sambas. Anyone ever give these a try? ,"I've always been an on-and-off casual biker and just got my first ""big boy"" bike, that came with clip-in pedals, so I figured I'd give a shot at clipless cycling shoes. While I was looking around for a pair of somewhat decent looking bike shoes, I didn't find many that looked casual enough to walk around with in-between rides, so these Sambas were a great option for me because they're functional and stylish. 

I'm a big Nike gut so I really think Nike needs to give us some more cycling shoe options... Right now the only pair I see on their website is the SuperRep Cycle 2. I would really love to see some signature lifestyle hybrid biking shoes from Nike, like an AJ1, Dunk or AirMax. Adidas has been killing it with the amount of biking shoe options they have and Nike's just there in the corner, quiet lol.

adidas samba,I can't understand why people follow trends (Adidas Samba rant),"To preface, I'm terrible at buying shoes and I spend a lot of time researching until I find something I really like. 5 years back I discovered GAT-type shoes and Sambas, and I bought a pair, and later another one. I enjoyed finding a model I really liked and one that fit my style. At the time, barely anyone was wearing Sambas where I live and whenever I saw someone else wearing them I positively felt that we shared the same style.

Fast forward a couple of years and I see Samba's on the street EVERYWHERE. 

What's confusing for me is why everyone started wearing them now becuase theres a ""trend"" going on. Sambas were available for a long time and most people I see are wearing the most basic model, so not even some special colorway that didn't exist before.

Why does this happen? Why do people wait for something to be ""trendy"" in order to buy it? ",0,11,2024-06-12 04:05:51,Sneakers

""JJJJound is a Montreal-based studio and creative collective founded by Justin Saunders in 2006. The brand is known for its minimalist aesthetic. Over the years, JJJJound has gained a cult following for its meticulous curation and attention to detail, appealing to a discerning audience that appreciates thoughtful and well-crafted design.""

Over the past weeks, there has been a promotional campaign consisting of video and photo posts across Adidas and JJJJound social media channels for the shoe. There's even a [commercial](https://www.instagram.com/adidasoriginals/reel/C4vgXpyIPSi/) shot in the German factory with a German employee doing voice-over. The upper is already assembled and they are only lasting and attaching sole. His [website](https://www.jjjjound.com/password) features another video in the German factory, which also shows the uppers already assembled and ready. The site reads ""The JJJJound Adidas Samba - Made in Germany will be available today at 12 PM EST.""

There's been some bickering in the comments as usual, but when you look through comments, you'll see one commonality. People stick up for the shoes and defend the price tag based on the fact that the Made in Germany quality far exceeds your standard Samba.

**Except for one thing,** they're not *really* Made in Germany.

As r/jjjjound user u/pizzapants666 shows in his [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/jjjjound/comments/1boq18h/jjjjound_samba_made_in_vietnam_tag/), the entire upper of the shoe is clearly labeled as Made in Vietnam. In that case, the only thing happening in Germany is lasting them and attaching soles.

**Here's a direct link to the image of the tag:** 

https://i.redd.it/tijg7ero8sqc1.jpeg

**Here's a link to the video where the screenshot comes from:**

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4-ThmEy64C/

If the entire upper of the shoe is Made in Vietnam and the only thing happening in Germany is lasting and soles being attached, how and why are they marketing this is a Made in Germany release and carrying over the price associated with that to the customer?

adidas samba,Made in Italy Samba,"Got these and they are exactly as good as I hoped. Key difference other than the ridiculously nice leather-they even smell good, like new, real leather should, are:

Slightly different shape. Top down view has more curves than the standard Samba. Laterally the toe box is a bit higher.

Sole feels a little more firm. I‚Äôm wearing a pair of Nice Kicks Samba now, and they are definitely‚Äùgummier‚Äù. The color is a more pronounce peanut butter vs the black and white OG model. Molding/tooling of the outsole itself is more crisp. Underfoot they feel less padded than modern pairs, but not uncomfortable. The dress shoe influence is apparent here. 

Tongue is composed of a single, stitch-free piece of very nice leather. Again, another dress shoe construction detail, as expected for a shoe like this. 

Lining is all a glove soft leather. There is no ‚Äúgenuine leather‚Äù, which means blend of leather dust and plastic, on this shoe. I‚Äôm confident these will mold to the wearers foot in short order. 

Overall construction is at a level well above what Adidas usually puts out. Which in my experience is already very good. Stitching is flawless, and the subtle Italian tri-color detail on the heel is nice. 

Overall I‚Äôm definitely impressed, and they‚Äôre keepers, even though I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll be a lot of flipping on these. They won‚Äôt be an everyday wear/daily, but they‚Äôll be in the rotation for sure. Another good thing about these, Sambas never go out of style.",48,15,2024-02-01 08:23:13,Sneakers

* Nike has over saturated the market with Jordan 1/2/3/4s and dunks, nearly taking away all their hype/appeal

* there hasn‚Äôt been a good air max release of 2023

* yeezy month is the most important event in sneaker culture this year, so far. So many new sneakerheads/collectors popped up with the month of sales

* NB the lowkey top dog in sneaker culture for the year - really impressed with their ability to move on from the 550 hype in a positive way. Avoided becoming ‚Äúlast year‚Äôs trendy brand‚Äù

adidas samba,Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 Slip Ons Review,"Am on Japan on vacation and bought two pairs of the canvas Mexico 66s, which are as cool-looking a shoe as there is out there currently. The torch has been passed from the Adidas sambas to Onitsuka Mexico 66‚Äôs.

With that said, upon my first night wearing them the bottom of my feet were in such unbelievable pain. I tried to give them a go the next morning and like magic they were fine‚Ä¶ have been walking around with them on the last few days and I generally feel pretty good, not to mention they look amazing. 

While they were giving me a hard time, I scoured Reddit to see if there were any reviews or advice on them, of which there isn‚Äôt much. So below are a few bullets you should know before or after buying.

1. They look spectacular‚Ä¶
- what leads them looking this way are their incredible thin soles.

2. Thin soles
- so thin, you can feel just about anything you walk over. Have never walked in a sole so thin in my life. And I have never had any issues with my feet ever. My arches are totally normal, etc, etc. As mentioned above, if you‚Äôre feeling pain after the first time, hopefully it improves upon further wears and your foot is getting used to it.

3. Do not walk far and definitely do NOT run in them.
- these are for more casual strolls. Not for running a marathon despite what you see online.

4. Buy insoles
- I bought some which I will try upon returning from my trip. I think it will make walking in these a much more pleasurable experience.

Hopefully this helps with any questions you might have. They‚Äôre great-looking sneakers, and definitely take some getting used to, and in the sake of full transparency aren‚Äôt the world‚Äôs most comfortable sneakers‚Ä¶",17,18,2023-08-28 00:46:00,Sneakers

Never had the chance to try on GATs but they look sort of similar to Sambas and I think it's a really great looking style. Just from the look of them they seem narrow but it's difficult to judge.

I'll just say for reference that AF1's fit me and I own a pair. I've tried on high top blazers and they fit me but are uncomfortable as hell so I sent them back.

adidas samba,Adidas Samba sizing heeeelppp!!,"Hey so with the recent samba craze I decided to order some to see what the hype was about. I ordered one pair of classics in 44eu(9.5uk, 10us) sizing, but got some major heel slippage. I then tried on the samba ADV in the 43 1/3 sizing( so half a size smaller), and they are fine length-wise, but fit pretty narrow. Not to the point that im numb in my feet, but i fear it might cause some slight discomfort with more frequent use. So my question is will the leather stretch naturally or should I just bail on the samba(which would suck cause I really enjoy their look).  


TLDR: Adidas Samba in 44eu sizing is too long, but in 43 1/3 is too narrow.  
 What should i do?  


  
Also worth noting that due to how adidas exchanges work i also have a pair of the samba classics on the way in 43 1/3, but i don't know whether they differ in how they fit in comparison with the ADV.",2,2,2023-01-19 11:56:36,Sneakers
adidas samba,Am I not a real sneakerhead for not preferring Nike? I think growing up around hype has affected my enjoyment of sneakers.,"I want to start this post with saying that I have sneakers from all kinds of brands. I have multiple from adidas, Nike, New Balance, Converse, Puma. I started getting into sneakers when I was in High School, wore a lot of adidas Superstars, was a late bloomer and didn't really get into the hobby until college where I got a pair of Nike Pegasus 35 and adidas NMDs. Growing up I got made fun of a lot because I didn't have Jordans, and I think instead of making me want them more, it made me resentful? I'm not sure how to word it.

Fast forward to now, and my collection is primarily adidas and New Balance with a peppering of Nike. I've had multiple Nike shoes in the past but never really loved them, either they didn't fit right or weren't as comfortable as I hoped. The best pair was a set of Huraches, had those for a long time. 

My adidas have always been my favorite shoes in my collection, Ultraboost DNA, NMDs, Ozweego, Ozelia, Sambas etc. But all my friends say I'm not a real sneakerhead because I don't wear Jordans or Dunks, and I've never had a pair of AF1s. It's not that I don't want them, but I've never gone out of my way to get them. Lately with all the issues with Kanye, now I've been getting a lot of critiques for not having more Nike, and wearing adidas. Most people now either hate adidas because they dropped Kanye, hate them because they still sell Yeezys, or aren't happy that they took so long to drop him in the first place. 

Am I a bad sneakerhead? Am I doing something wrong? Should I be looking at getting more Nike shoes? Just looking for advice!",1,10,2023-01-13 19:26:53,Sneakers

The last pair has been a little bit trickier, and I'm not sure if my memory if failing or if I've combined two pairs or who knows what. These shoes would have been released in 1991 or 1992, and what I remember is that they were a black nubuck-type leather with turquoise and purple accents. I also remember a toggle for the shoelaces. My memory says that they were Jordan 6s, but Nike didn't release a pair of Jordan 6s in that colorway. In my minds eye, it would be the Jordan 6 ""Black Infrared"" in a colorway similar to the Air Jordan 8 ""Aqua"". 

Any ideas what these could be? Perhaps Nike released a pair similar to the Jordan 6s that weren't Jordans?",2,8,2022-01-06 10:42:17,Sneakers

adidas samba,"[Discussion] Inspired by the Roshe post, I need some help finding the shoe that got me into sneakers - a Brooks running shoe that I can't seem to remember the model name and that I can't track down googling.","Pretty much the same story - my family was never the one to spend more than $40-50 on any kind of footwear and I never really thought much about shoes until my junior year in high school (2000-2001). I wouldn't say there were (m)any sneakerheads at my school, but I definitely remember that the most popular models were Sambas, Air Max Plus, and Brooks running shoes.

I was obsessed with this one pair of Brooks and took a while to save up to buy this shoe. It was the most expensive sneaker I had bought up until like 4-5 years ago when I started to collect. I beat these shoes to hell and wore them with everything because I did not care - they were too awesome not to rock. 

I am 90%+ sure that they were called Tsunami. They were red, black, and silver (maybe white?). The outsole had these black and green rubber oval pods for traction. I just spent like an hour googling them and nothing...Unfortunately, I apparently have no pictures of myself from that time that show my feet????? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

*Also, if anyone knows where I can find a pair of Adidas Superstar ""High Roller"" in a size 10, I'd super appreciative as well! Lots of sentimental value.",1,0,2021-10-18 21:12:22,Sneakers

1. Comfortable walking/light hiking/running shoes - I typically walk my dog on a trail daily that is 3 miles. 3 miles a day adds up pretty quickly with other walking so it‚Äôs easy for me to rack up miles on shoes. I tried wearing hiking boots from L.L. Bean but they screwed up my heels. I tried Nike Metcons but they fell apart very quickly and were not comfortable on my arches. Not looking to run long distances but sometimes I‚Äôll jog a few miles. 

2. Can be worn/ look nice at the gym - I typically lift 5 days a week at the gym. So I need a shoe that will be comfortable for squats and such but also look good with gym attire. Shouldn‚Äôt be too bulky like hiking boots. 

3 Look good going out to bars/dinners/friends house in jeans or shorts - As mentioned above I have no style when it comes to shoes I typically just like stuff that‚Äôs plain and it‚Äôs hard for me to imagine if they‚Äôd be considered stylish or not. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I don‚Äôt really have a budget so any suggestions are welcome. Through my initial searches I‚Äôve looked at mainly trail running shoes to try and tick all the boxes but some of the styles are a little crazy (looking at you Salomon) or they‚Äôre too blocky like Merrells.

I was going to go to the US but I have no information because of trump's tax problems. How about Dubai? I'm planning to rent an airbnb and order haul. Has anyone ordered airbnb or hotel before? If I can solve this problem I want to get LJR batch Travis scott. I can get a visa for Dubai, but I have never been there. I have been to America many times and I speak a little English, which one would make more sense for me? Dubai tickets are cheap and attract me",1,1,2025-04-29 06:46:32,FashionReps

yeezy,6kg haul to the uk (review below) from CnFans,"Acne Paint Jeans 8/10 : Very comfortable, shape holds up really well, sits well on shoes, a bit thin in my opinion.

Akimbo zip up 7/10 : it‚Äôs really thick so perfect for winter/autumn seasons, shape is nice and baggy, colour is rlly nice looks 1:1 to the real one.

Chrome hearts glasses 9/10: very nice, blue light, shape is really nice and I love the colour.

Kobe 6 all stars 2.0 s2 batch 9/10? : I still haven‚Äôt tried them on court so I‚Äôm not sure but they feel very sturdy and the cushioning feels nice.

Yeezy slide bone GX batch 10/10 : they‚Äôre perfect for this summer love them.

EYBL shorts 4/10 : quality doesn‚Äôt seem that good and even tho I bought large my height is 6‚Äô1 they‚Äôre still somehow too small for me.

Rimowa phone case 10/10 : perfect 

Supreme boxers 10/10 : they‚Äôre on the pricier side but they‚Äôre still very comfortable and perfect true to size.

AirPods Max V2 airoha black 7/10 : you get what you pay for basically noice cancellation ain‚Äôt that great but they‚Äôre worth it and they look 1:1

yeezy,Favorite Reps I‚Äôve Gotten In the Past 5 Years (US user‚Äôs farewell),"In memory of the de minimis exemption being revoked, i thought i would put together a little list of my favorite items that I have gotten from hauls over the past 5 years. 

Thank you and I can provide w2c‚Äôs if there is a link that still exists, bear with me some of these are old as time.

#1: this large Alyx backpack has been my daily for the last 2 years and is such a quality backpack.  I have purchased 2 of the smaller bags from Grailed previously but this one can actually fit all my stuff for school lmao. 

#2: Salehe Bembury x crocs collab.  Holy mother of god, this has been my daily (as you can tell) wear to the gym and around the house.  I LOVE these shoes.  

#3: Unreleased Military Blue Fragment TS Low Jordan 1s.  These are absolutely my favorite pair of Travis‚Äôs im not a big fan of brown shoes so the other pairs never really did it for me.  W2C: https://k.youshop10.com/5WKVC3jB

#4: Fragment Design x Thunderbolt Project (Pokemon) Mew Plush (gimp??) I am so blown away with this thing, it was only $20 and it is the coolest plush ive ever seen.  I got the Pikachu one as well and it‚Äôs more like a regular one not leather, but I love the high quality of this thing and it‚Äôs huge.  W2C: https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=643109285241

#5: im putting together all my 4s and Air Yeezys in one bunch bc panda/acbuy finally let me cop some of these grails of mine.  W2C: Levi‚Äôs: https://k.youshop10.com/yrte1fiS
Yeezy: pandabuy link dead üíÄ
Snorlax 4s: same situation link ded 

#6: Pharrell ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù jeans Louis Vuitton: I love these jeans they r so fun, I was gonna put the basic black chrome jeans in this list but I got these 2 hauls back and have loved em since. W2C: https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=845612996712

#7: Bearbricks, I just got 2 of these in my last haul but I love them now, they r pretty cheap from China so I got a few before they will be harder to get. W2C: https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=742116542711&from=redirectFromAutoCallApp

#8: Nike Air Prestos x Off-White ‚Äúwhite‚Äù:  I loved these shoes so much that I bought a second pair.  Honestly some of the best reps I have found and I think they are mad comfy.  The ones on the right are after 3 years of wear and the others are brand new.  W2C: https://k.youshop10.com/ciojnihf

#9: LV Watercolor Knit Sweater: Unfortunately no W2C on this one but I think some sellers like 8billion have this if you dig deep enough on his Lv page.  But this was one item that really made me get into reps. 

#10: Rep closet - I def have spent more than I would have assumed at the beginning of this Rep adventure but I am very satisfied with all the items I have gotten and I wonder how going back to buying retail will be‚Ä¶. Anyhow with that I want to thank this community it‚Äôs been a good 5 years, and maybe see you soon if Trump can reinstate that shi. ",31,21,2025-04-27 20:03:48,FashionReps

yeezy,5.5KG First Haul to US East Coast | Acne | Arcteryx | Patagonia | Stone Island | AF1 | Yeezy | Umbro,"I paid $130 in shipping through eEMS and it only took 8 days. MuleBuy was great for my first haul, the communication and packaging was great; the experience was so good I already started a new haul through them.

Stats: 5‚Äô11‚Äù, 180lbs athletic/muscular build.

Umbro x Slam Jam Hoodie ($35) - The hoodie is heavy, the material feels great, and the stitching looks sharp. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=867112082776

Acne Studios Jacket ($39) - The material feels nice, the printing on the front feels like it may come off after several washes but that is just an assumption, overall it is a nice piece. https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7377957463

Taco Bell Shirt ($9) - Printing and fabric feels durable, can‚Äôt go wrong with this one. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=669202288816

Stone Island Bucket Hat ($6) - Looks good, feels good. The drawstring has a unique but nice locking mechanism. https://shop1303790680.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4396383709

Patagonia Bucket Hat ($8) - Feels durable but the shape is slightly strange when its on your head, could probably just use some breaking in. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=878246626306

Arc‚Äôteryx Cross Body Bag ($12) - Very light weight, plenty of space and additional pockets inside. https://detail.1688.com/offer/892204407936.html

Patagonia Baggies Shorts ($12) - They look and feel great, very similar to an old retail pair. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=876606493347

Arc‚Äôteryx Reflective Shirts ($15) - I am impressed with the thickness of these shirts, I got one in white and black, the print is reflective but there is a strange artifact on the back to the bottom right of the logos but I would still recommend them. https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7246155408

Yeezy 350 V2 ($24) - As far as I am concerned they look real, they feel durable, and are very comfortable. TTS. https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7298405582

Air Force 1s ($12) - They look good and don‚Äôt feel cheap despite the incredibly low price; relatively comfortable but I have yet to wear them out. TTS. https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7325631661",26,20,2025-04-25 15:00:49,FashionReps

yeezy,9.5KG haul to Canada,"First time making a review since like '16. Used to be big in the rep game back when yeezy 350 turtle dove was first released. When the community was debating about the turtledove 8 eye placements, the slants and angles of the patterns, the shape of the boost on the bottom. David or ZZTOP had the best batch?? 

Anyways, I am sad to see the community going from nitpicking the minute details to labelling anything to 10/10. I have spent thousands on reps and threw away/donated most of them cause of cheap material and poor constructions. My review for this haul will be upheld to my standard with authentic clothing, looking at material, shape, construction, quality, and fit. I will only give 10/10 to deserving pieces. That being said, here we go.

I used Mulebuy, 9.5 kg, $93USD/$128CAD, used China post-MG-JM line, took 17days exactly to Canada. Declared less than 20$CAD for the entire haul. No problems with customs, no tariffs, no taxes.   

The items I chose are mostly from reputable sellers found across the different rep subreddits. I GP'ed a few items without too much reviews. I will be posting mulebuy links as I am trying to get their reward system thing so we will see how this works. Just being transparent. 

Shipping/agent review:

Mulebuy was easy to work with, usually takes 1-2 business days to place orders. QC pics are ok. Parcel was packed well, individually wrapped as seen in the pics. Shipping is a bit expensive but it's been working for me so I am sticking with it. The only downside is the time exchanging communication with the agent, sometimes it takes a whole business day to get a response but it's fine, time difference I guess. Overall experience: 8/10. If the shipping cost is lower and faster communication, I'd give the experience 9/10. 

  
Item reviews:

Personal stat: 6'2, 190lbs, ok muscular build. Usually wear size 10 US for shoes & between M/L for tops. 33 waist for Jeans.

1. New Balance 530 - Milk Tea colorway. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7237472694](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7237472694)

Got these for my wife, the pictures shown on seller page looks more beige, the QC photos from Mulebuy looks beige as well, but item in hand show some slight pink hues. Wife was unhappy about the colors at first as she is often picky but ended up liking them after wearing them as her primary shoes for a trip. No one will legit check you for NB, I was most worried about comfort and she said it felt great and didn't hurt at all during the trip. We walked an average of 15k steps per day for 6 days straight, shoe held up well, no pain or discomfort which is a plus. 8/10 (2 points off for color difference and wife's initial dissatisfaction) 

  
2.  Converse Chuck 70s - White. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=4405090738](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=4405090738)

Got these again for wife. Sized down half size due to recommendations from other redditors. Fits well. I had these in black in men from previous haul and it's held up well. Wife says the toebox plastic feels fake but she has no idea what she's talking about. Feels fine and looks fine to me. Once again no one LC converse chucks so I worry most about comfort. My experience with my own pair has been good. The laces lost its shape a little after a few months but no other problems. 9/10 

  
3.  NB 1906 - White/Green. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7242844795](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7242844795)

Got these in 43=43.5, comes as US men 9.5, was hoping for US men 10, should've sized up. It fits me but fits me SNUG. I have overpronation so hopefully it won't wreck the shoes too fast. quality feels ok, accuracy is good but saw a retail pair the other day and the retail has a more pronounced shape and box. Just came back from grocery shopping in them to test these, walked around 2k steps, felt fine. Only complaint is narrow toebox and feels like im walking very close to the ground. I never had the narrow toebox problem so these might fit narrow/tight. Overall regretted not sizing up, hopefully they hold up and not cause too much feet pain. 6/10 

  
4. Doc Martens - Black. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=4296908270](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=4296908270)

Got these in 43, comes as US men 10. TTS, fits well. Construction looks good, tight stitching, one loose thread at the tongue. Feels durable. Biggest complaint is the leather/plastic. I felt a pair of retail (not sure if it was the made in england or thailand version) and the leather/plastic on the retail felt much thicker and durable. These are already kinda creasing after trying them on and bending the toe box a little bit. But for the price, not bad. 6/10 

  
5. Nike socks - Black & White. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7277013760](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7277013760)

Fit well but material is very thick. Felt almost unnatural. Some lint balls as you take them off, but they're just Nike socks. Which the cotten was thinner but more compact. When you walk in them it feels like the material glides slightly between the contact surface, gave me some footpain with my overpronation. Could be my shoes though. 7/10 

  
6. Blank Artiemaster Tank. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=ali\_1688&id=863494916888](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=ali_1688&id=863494916888)

Got these in size L, thin cotton material, hate the side openings. It felt like someone just ran it through with a scissor. Fits a bit too wide and unnatural. Will try to shrink them on purpose in dryer to see if the fit improves. Maybe I just got the wrong size. Tank in wash as I type this. 5/10 

7. Black Carhartt Stallion T - Black. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=857493680213](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=857493680213)

Got these in size L from Saul goodman (look him up on yupoo). Had a big selection. The fit is pretty good, material slightly thin, after receiving I realized this may be a fantasy piece. Seen some authentic in white but none in black. At the end of the day, who cares? Just Carhartt. Wish material good be thicker and boxier. 7/10

  
8. RL Polo - XL Navy Blue. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7221752639](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7221752639)

Got these from RepKingdom, seen raving reviews for this seller. Was not disappointed. Material feels nice, fits well. compared to retail I think it's slightly thinner, but the difference is not noticeable. 9.5/10 

  
9. A\*LD shorts - Green Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=809568916897](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=809568916897)

Got these from TSARCHIVE, heard he is one of the better A\*LD sellers. The color is way greener than I thought, thought it would be a more darker green color instead of shiny forest green. Will need to change my ideas of outfits with this one. The materials actually feel REALLY nice, the waist band is thick, the cloth is heavy, doesn't feel like your regular mesh gym shorts. Feels premium, just a bit upset about the color. Not sure how the retail pairs look but I will rock them regardless. 8/10 

  
10. Carhartt Detroit Jacket J97 - Size XL, Moss Green. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=ali\_1688&id=709715593267](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=ali_1688&id=709715593267)

Saw some others review this jacket, got them in XL because I saw one user mentioning that it fits short. I shouldn't have listened because I ordered 1 size larger than the measurement that fitted me and it was too big. If I had just gone with the measurement it would fit better. Maybe QC issues with consistency? IDK. The material is thick and heavy, some lint balls already coming out though. The collar is just dyed with brown, can clearly see how it's kinda sprayed on as it's not done cleanly. Going to wash it and shrink it to see if it fits better. Overall a bit disappointed in this piece due to sizing, lint balls, and the dyed collar. I am unsure if there is a better batch out there tbh, I have looked everywhere on subreddits and this was the best batch with cheapest price. I might be wrong, please comment if you know alternatives. I might look on ebay for a vintage retail. 5/10 

  
11. IDLT shorts - Grey Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=723527917267](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=723527917267)

Wanted to get a pair of IDLT blank shorts and a Artiemaster to compare. 100% cotton, feels like it. Solid build, good stitching, good material. More expensive than Artiemaster, and I personally prefer the Artiemaster more. If you like light weight shorts, you might prefer this one. 7/10 



12. Artiemaster shorts - Washed black Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=ali\_1688&id=885330906540](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=ali_1688&id=885330906540)

Love love LOVE this pair of shorts for the price. 430 GSM, 100% cotton. Really feels solid in hands. Fits well, heavy weight. Feels premium for sure. If I buy something like this at the mall I am probably looking at 60-80$ cad due to quality. These only cost 10ish $cad. Best bang for my buck for sure. Already have a few more Artiemaster sweats in my cart that I am going to try. Will always go for 100% cotton. 9.5/10

  
13. CDG homme shirt - White, Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=692707728424](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=692707728424)

Got these from RepBrothers. Really like the design and saw he carried them. Known reputable seller for PA. The fit is ok, definitely too long for my liking. The material is thin but holds the shape, my nipples aren't showing through them. The neckline is a bit loose but we will see how it holds up. Wish it was shorter and more cropped but it may be just how the shirt is built. The print looks fine. Will be layering with these and tucking them in. 7/10

  
14. A\*LD T Shirt - White, Size M. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=730699752212](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=730699752212)

Got these from TSARCHIVE like the green gym shorts. Slightly disappointed in these after seeing how well the gym shorts were constructed. The materials feel thin, length slightly too long, sleeves a tad short, and the shape is flimsy, can see my nips through them as they are tight around the chest but the shoulder lines sits right. IDK, putting them in the wash now hopefully it shrinks in length and not around the chest (lol). Maybe this is just how the authentic fits and feel? Never felt or try the retail so I can't compare. Slightly disappointed but will try to make this work into my layering and tucked. 5/10

  
15. A\*LD Socks 

From TSARCHIVE as well. Looks fine. Just socks, havent tried them on yet. Embroidery looks fine. 

  
That's it! Thanks for reading and hopefully this helps other redditors with your decision making like how these subs have helped me. ",58,25,2025-04-23 16:14:38,FashionReps

1. Yeezy 500 LW Batch ¬•380
9/10 
I like these shoes, I think they are the best batch for 350 and 500, I had original yeezy 500 and these are just as comfortable, I recommend it but it's a bit expensive

2. Dunk budget ¬•99
8/10
it's size 39, the budget version has no glue or other defects, I don't know anything about dunks but I think it's worth it for the price


3. Belt no brand, like chrome hearts 88¬•

chrome hearts style belt, gothic, very nice quality, lots of details, I recommend

4. LV budget belt ¬•12

ridiculously cheap strap I added it just for testing and for 12 yuan you can't go wrong with it

5. Supreme duffel ¬•188

nice gym bag, lots of compartments, I thought it would be a bit bigger but ok

nice accessory but it scratches a bit, I wanted a regular bracelet and when it came I saw that it was a cartier copy

8. Smd boxers 22¬•

I already had it in M, I really liked it but it was very tight in the sleeves and waist, so not very comfortable. I took it back in the right size and I'm still happy with it. Super-soft fabric inside, quite thick, good finish (except for 2/3 threads sticking out on the logo, but quick to remove)... nothing to say.

Ami Zip - 466CNY - Size L (size up)

I hesitated a lot before buying it, because I was afraid of how it would fit. In the end it's amazing, I'm very happy with the purchase but the zip is very tough. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any ideas to overcome this problem.

Stone Island Short - 10 - 228CNY

It's great quality, I have nothing to say about that. I advise you to size up. However, the only issue is the patches, so I would still recommend getting some from TopStoney and putting them on.

yeezy,13kg EastMallBuy haul (review) ü•∂üì¶,"
Hello all, in this post I‚Äôm reviewing all the products that i ordered and received. Mind you, I just received this order so it is purely on first in-hand impressions and not how they hold up or anything like that because i haven‚Äôt had the chance to yet.

I ordered this haul using EastMallBuy as my agent. This was my 5th haul or so with them and i‚Äôve been sticking with them since the raids. They are very good and the shipping prices are very fair, I paid $180 for 13kg.

Here are all the item links and what i think of each item in-hand. If there is interest in more detailed pictures of certain items please lmk and I‚Äôll make a separate post!


Mihara sneakers $30: Really good quality especially for $30 I love the look of them sadly they don‚Äôt fit because the person i got this link from said to size down. I did exactly that but now they are too smallü•≤ I‚Äôm reordering them in the correct size because these are definitely worth the price! 9.8/10ü•∂

Nocta Tech: From Dragonrep, best tracksuit i have ever owned. 10/10 Purchase, will get lightblue forsure! For Baggy Pants fit take your normal size, for zipper if you want slim fit get one size smaller.

Yeezy Slides 7$: Good Quality Yeezy Slide, will get another pair also forsure :)

Pingubuy Review: Despite beeing a agent which i havent used so far everything went very well, products got copped very fast. Support on discord is very nice and good aswell. I sent the package out on 22.2 and received it today so 10/11 days which is pretty fast. Shipping Cost was also very low. I paid 27$ for 2.3kg which is fair.

The website is the exact same as Hagobuy was - easy to navigate. I picked up a few trendy clothes and some other essential items. I haven't received the items in hand yet, but I‚Äôm already looking forward to making another purchase. All items were purchased by Kakobuy within 1-7 hours.

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=833570596039

supreme martin rose jeans - so at first those jeans are really oversized like really, they are not like baggy but they are really big, the whole leg is not going smaller they overally just big, even that I still recommend you to take your true size and you should still look good in it but they are bigger than other sup jeans I owned, even that they are pretty thick so they feel really good quality

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=869009004839

Arte trackpants - I wanted some trackpants for running n stuff and for some reason I took this color thinking it will look cool I mean if you can style it I guess it can look great but I just wanted to run in it so I could easily take some black pants but what ever, the pants are acually good quality and fit and sit pretty well even that there is just thi little branding they are clean in term of design so can recommend this one

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=835749589952

arte cardigan - yesterday I saw there a guy reviewing this one with feet so I will try to do it without showing it to you O:) overally good quality the review I saw was saying its 100% wool personally I cant really tell this but yea its pretty high quality and its mainly made well, for the fit take a true size, I sized up once and its not looking the best when its little oversized as I thought I can size u but nah, print is really well made I like the embro there and mainly I could not find any lose stiches even that its whole embroided

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=868994636265 

stussy polo tee - this design is clean I mean really really clean like perfect :D, quality is fine and its actually sooo comfy to wear cant wait for summer frfr, the design and the embroidery on this pieces is made really close to real one, for sizing I sized up and did a good choice but if you want the more slim fit easily can go with true size as I think this was made to fit like the classic polos

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=820019527440

erd hoodie - I just liked how simple this hoodie is but now as I now what does it mean It feel bit weird, it translate as ""rich depresssed kids"" and I am not really sure its fitting my aesthetic but still looking good, the fit is cropped but I actually like it so I dont recommend changing sizes on this one

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=850174196985

represent hoodie - really simple hoodie with embroidery, just clean piece, I would take your normal size as its already bit oversized so it wont be too much

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=862085657896

ACG puffer - I riped off my CP company from my last haul so I needed some new one :)))) overally well made, it keeps you warm and its really simple jacket at end of the day just simple logo on front, if you still looking for some puffer this might be a good choice, could be cool if you could remove the hood but anyways its a good one and take your true size or check size chart I was deciding if I should size down or not but there are strings on the waist area so you can tight it up when its gonna feel long for you

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=853126593341

VD tee - totally simple tee, if youi like the design take it but size up for better fit

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=826218169250

Arte tee - same as stussy tee got from this seller and love to come back to it its really great quality and mainly its thick and for the price I think 15‚Ç¨ its total steal my whole summer rotation will be with those arte tees but still some time to be there, take a size bigger

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=880287615091

FOG tee - wanted something simple like this and it actually is, need to style it really well to make it look great but it should not be a problem, I wanted it to not be as much oversized as other hoodies so I took my normal size but could easily even size down I think for more slimmer fit and still be good

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=862085657896

jdaded london jeans - happy that we got a batch of those even that the retail one is not that expnesive I feel like paying 40+$ for jeans is nonsense, okey denim quality overally I dont think its worth to overpay for those

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7386839343

Stussy cdg tee - bacis stussy tee, quality on this one is good already have from this seller, even after some washes it wont shrink so thats why I keep buying this batch and if you want I recommend to size up for better fit

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=797353537413

essential swetpants - really similiar to the yeezy season 6 one the clean one but those seems cleaner, I really think this was insane find by me, quality is really well and it fits really well, its wide on the bottom so watch out

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=879632365960

yeezy,Greg ross hoodie in hand rev,"I want to start by saying that i searched a lot for greg ross reps, so now other people like me dont have to search days.
Greg Ross is a pretty wierd designer but i like his stuff, whitout further shi lets get into the rev:

1. Build quality ( i am a tailor so i can talk abt the build quality :) )

- stitching: its not visible so not much abt it
- build: outher material is hoodie like material and inner is shirt like ( same as the yeezy gap hoodies )
- materials: seem rlly good total weight was 1400

2. Fit 

- the fit of this hoodie is cropped and boxy ( u can see by lookimg at the photos

3. Practicality

-i'd say its pretty practical cuz it warms u up rlly fast so im gn use it all season ( summer as jacket, winter as hoodie) cuz weather in my country is goofy 

Conclusion: so ye its a good hoodie i like it and i think it was worth it shipping it 

PLEASE lmk if you guys have any other greg ross hoodie links

yeezy,Kickwho word of warning,So I ordered a pair of size 13 fragment lows from the godkiller us warehouse. When they arrived I knew it was wrong. I opened the box and found a pair of size 7.5. I got a hold of them and was asked about some 3 digit number on the box. After that I sent the number and then got a message saying sorry how about this as a solution. If you give us 50 you keep the 7.5 and we will send the size 13. That didn't sound like the worst deal since I could give the 7.5 to someone. So then I am asked to send a friends and family PayPal to pay the 50. I reluctant did that after seeing people happy with kickwho. So then they ask if I want to pick out two more pair for 200 and they will send it all at once. I said no just send the fragments but they asked again. Reluctant ly I said ok. Thinking again after seein all the decent stuff about kickwho. So again 200 friends and family to paypal which I never do. So I asked for QC pics and was told they would be sent right out. Well I got pics posted them here actually. Then nothing. Well here is where the trouble starts. I initially messaged kickwho on Instagram and then got some replies from another kickwho Instagram. This has all been 12 days ago. Now the first kickwho Instagram is asking me to send the shoes back and then they will pay for the shipping and send the shoes I paid for. They said the would give a us address but they never have. Not that I would send what I do have back on my dime anyways not knowing what is what. Both Instagram accts knew or were able to access parts of my info. They message in the middle of the night so I don't get the messages usually till the next day. It has been an absolute nightmare. Currently I have shoes that are worth nothing because they are reps and have lost 250 bucks. Figured I would post as a word of warning. If they make this right great. Here are pics of both Instagram accts. ,1,8,2025-01-24 03:02:19,FashionReps

Yeezy Desert Boots - 9/10 - $68.36 - I really like these shoes but I am no expert on the originals so can't tell small flaws but they are comfortable and feel sturdy. The only thing about them is they need a bit of breaking in as many shoes do. I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price but these are definitely worth it and high quality at least for the world of reps. Fits me to my translated size

Kanye West College Dropout Bapes - 7/10 - $31.90 - Love the design and I can't complain fits me to my translated size. Just doesn't blow me away but good quality and a solid shoe. I can't tell the difference but someone who knows what they are looking for probably could.

Burberry x Supreme Collared Puffer Jacket - 10/10 - $130.34 - Now it may be a bit ridiculous to spend this much on a rep but it really goes to show how much these designers are overcharging because this is supper high quality. Warm, rain resistant, and looks like the real deal. I will wear this until I can't anymore feel good, looks good, and the quality is good. Works just like any of my other legitimate puffers.

yeezy,Yeezy season 4 Combat Boot Alternative ,"
My favorite Yeezys are the boot designs and while I‚Äôm super lucky to have 2 pairs of desert boots and 500 tacticals, the pair that got me into Ye‚Äôs designs has always been the Season 4 Combat Boot. It‚Äôs so simple yet elegant, and I love the natural color palette. Anyways, I have a budgeting rule that I never going to spend more then $200 on a pair of shoes so alas I‚Äôll likely never own these boots. Plus, I have never seen any reps that come close to being accurate, or in a size 12.

Then, to my surprise I came across the UK company ‚ÄúSavage Island,‚Äù who has been making combat boots for quite some time and their signature model is a near 1:1 with the Yeezys! It looks like Ye lifted the design wholesale and that‚Äôs fantastic news for me because I copped the $70 boots and some fabric paint and they look nearly identical!

There are some small differences, most notably the quality. The boots are suede and decent quality, especially for the price, but don‚Äôt expect $500 luxury boots like the Yeezys. Aside from that, the main difference is the color of the nylon section, which will need to be painted. The color is hard to discern from the pics online, and my first try ended up far too silver. However, I think the light gray color of the Fabricoat Fabric Paint on Amazon is pretty close. If anyone out there has the real ones please let us know if the panels are more grey or silver, as some shots make it look almost metallic. 

Anyways, these are comfy AF, style easily, and I wanted to share my story on here in case anyone else wants to make themselves a pair! Remove the tag, tape around the sections, and paint the nylon gray. Repeat after first coat is dry, then spray clear sneaker protector to seal in the paint. Lace up and enjoy!

Comparing them side-by-side with a legit pair, it‚Äôs almost impossible to tell them apart. The iconic stripe, Boost sole, and stitching pattern are all spot on. Even the knit pattern and color hues match perfectly, which is often where replica pairs fall short. The comfort is exceptional, too; the cushioning feels just as responsive as the retail version which I honestly did not expect.

Unique parcel number: 1206555

[Salamon XT6: Insanely comfy and good quality. I wasn't expecting them to be waterproof but they suprisingly are. comfiest shoe I own insanely cushioned sole. The listing said to size up once or twice so I bought a 47 when im usually a 45\/46 and they fit perfectly for me. Misleading size and I have wide feet so a lot of shoes are awkward for me to wear but these are great. 8\/10](https://preview.redd.it/xxujkgj0ms9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e501449c4bcddcbefa16ac84b0a9c14cf1af765)

W2C: Dead link ):

[Asic Gel Nyc: Really good quality for the price no flaws that I have seen personally. Super comfy to wear although the sole is slightly more solid than usual making them slightly less comfortable side by side with retail but still a great shoe. 9\/10](https://preview.redd.it/65jk3xw8ms9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922dae9996261bb6cabd26268d9122957e0eed18)

W2C: Dead Link ):

[Acne studios belt: For the price I have no complaints, the belt itsself is good quality and the Acne studios logo is good quality metal and not flimsy. Not real leather but I wasn't excpecting that for the price. Fits well, as I excected 10\/10](https://preview.redd.it/9jyftyd0ns9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e13fa1c5b64c31e137cecb1db0e3a89d1484cfd7)

[Margiela Tee: Crazyyyyy quality for the price. Better than a lot of t shirts that I payed 100+ for. T shirt is 100&#37; cotton which is always nice and the print is 1:1 from what i can tell. Tags are perfect and the fit of the T shirt is great \(oversized and slightly boxy\). I bought size L and im 178cm and 78kg and it fits me good just a little long. 9\/10](https://preview.redd.it/zfho361zqs9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9f55129245f3fa9242e005d28d83865f26e312a)

[Acne studios 2023m paint splatter jeans: Highlight of the haul for me as i've wanted these for such a long time. the fit on them is insane and they're 1:1 although slightly shorter compared to retail. stitching on the jeans and around the patch is very good quality and 1:1. I've got a pair of acne jeans from topacney and side by side the topacney jeans have much better quality and more accurate size chart for only 4 euros price difference. Although the size chart is not perfect they actually fit me better than retail because they are slightly shorter.  They are good quality denim and are my favourite piece in my whole closet. Everything said still a 10\/10 for me. ](https://preview.redd.it/zsw8eb8jrs9e1.jpg?width=3022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37fae83c8c743f029648f27b568dd5e8d11f495b)

[Firerep oversized blank hoodie: craziest hoodie in my closet in terms of quality and thickness. Its made with very nice material so its the perfect balance between heavy weight but not like wearing a weighted blanket. A lot of heavyweight hoodies can be droopy but this fits perfectly and has a very nice shape. The inside material is the softest i've ever felt on a hoodie. The hood is double layered so has a very nice structure that is maintained whilst wearing. 10\/10 my current fav hoodieamazing for the price. ](https://preview.redd.it/lk6du6zass9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a06336902bfd28fb49394e54836d9bc235fabe42)

[Yeezy gap 20 dollar gosha hoodie: perfect fitting hoodie on body and quality is amazing and very thick, its got french terry on the inside with the cuffs being tight making it fit perfect. For the 10 euro price point it is a no brainer. The hood structure is lacking slightly for me as its rather thin but that is the only complaint I have for this hoodie. 8\/10](https://preview.redd.it/2phm0lwtss9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ba69f7adcd74c9918d2916cc6b9ee995c494e61)

[Yeezy gap perfect hoodie: great hoodie, super thick. The hood is extremely flimsy and the thinnest part of the hoodie whilst the actual hoodie is very very thick and high quality. Probably not the most 1:1 rep out there but for 14 euros its a very good blank and the fit is amazing.

yeezy,12KG AllChinaBuy Haul to USAüá∫üá∏‚ùÑÔ∏è(Almost $600),"I am extremely satisfied with my recent purchase, which marks my largest haul yet since the great incidentüêºüíî. For this shipment, I opted to use the AllChinaBuy agent. 

To mitigate the risk of seizure, I divided the haul into four separate boxes, though this decision significantly impacted the shipping costs.

The fastest delivery took 9 days, while the longest delivery time was 17 days.

**All links are in the comments**

Feel free to ask any questions. I'll be happy to help!

Arc‚Äôteryx Alpha SV: 9/10

‚Ä¢ Exceptional for the price of $60. I believe it contains real GORE-TEX. I performed the water test, and the water just beaded right off the jacket. True to size.
 
Ralph Lauren Cable-Knit Sweater: 10/10

‚Ä¢ Offered comfort and warmth. No bad smells at all. The sizing was literally perfect. In my opinion, one of the best purchases that was made in this haul. Wash delicately only.

Ralph Lauren Zip Hoodies: 9/10

‚Ä¢ Felt very high quality as if it was a legitimate Ralph Lauren Hoodie. Minimal, slight oversized fit. Worth wearing out casually. 

Other Ralph Lauren Zip Hoodie (budget): 5/10

‚Ä¢ Very dissatisfied with this purchase. I will most likely give away. The order came one size down, and the RL logo looked awfully large and disgusting. In the end you get what you pay for. Size up once or twice, if you do purchase.
 
Stussy T-Shirts: 9/10

‚Ä¢ These T-shirts offered excellent value for the price paid. I loved the bold and iconic graphics. The quality had a premium feel that didn‚Äôt suggest being inexpensive or discounted. True to size.

Other T-Shirts: 8/10

‚Ä¢ Not much to say about these T-shirts. I didn‚Äôt expect much from them. Mostly enjoyed the Porsche T-shirt. True to size.

Ralph Lauren T-Shirt: 8/10

‚Ä¢ Provided quality cotton and a breathable feel. The price was fine. Not much to complain about. The fit is regular and true to size.

Ralph Lauren Jogger Pants: 10/10

‚Ä¢ Very satisfied with my purchase. The Joggers felt  high quality, and also had a comfortable fit. In addition, the joggers were true to size.

Random Linen Pants: 5/10

‚Ä¢ I came across these pants using the image search function. The pants are see-through and the sizing is a large amount smaller, about 1-2 sizes.
  
Nike Jogger Pants: 9/10

‚Ä¢ The joggers are made of very thick material, which I enjoy. Product is good for the price. Perfect sizing. I am satisfied with this purchase.

Gym Sweatpants: 7/10

‚Ä¢ This item meets expectations given its price, and doesn't offer any particularly standout features. Sizing follows a more contemporary, slim- fit style.

Yeezy Slides: 9/10

‚Ä¢ Very satisfied. The texture was on point. The slides had a snug fit. Excellent for price. True to size. Arrived with a somewhat strong factory smell.

Budget Tasman Uggs: 5/10

‚Ä¢ Dissatisfied with this purchase. The ‚ÄúUGG‚Äù logo was thin compared to retail. Out of curiosity, I attempted to fix it by drawing over with a pen, but I completely botched the logo. Although I shouldn‚Äôt complain about the price.

Van Cleef Bracelet(right): 10/10

‚Ä¢ I truly enjoyed this item and was very satisfied with this purchase. Arrived with a gift bag and authenticity card. Worth every penny.

Budget Van Cleef Bracelet(left): 2/10

‚Ä¢ Extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. The bracelet broke the first day I wore it. Obviously cheap material.

Arc‚Äôteryx Beanie: 8/10

‚Ä¢ Solid item for the price paid. The beanie provides comfort and warmth. Lovely accessory for winter.

Ralph Lauren Socks: 4/10

‚Ä¢ Very dissatisfied with this purchase. The socks were very thin compared to retail, the sizing was of a child‚Äôs foot. Never buying replica socks again.

Palace Stickers: 9/10

‚Ä¢ Not much to say about stickers. Good for the price.

Rating: 9/10
Seller: Bound2
Price: ¬•499
Size: Medium
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=683748985499

Logo might be slightly off centre but the fits so baggy you can‚Äôt tell. Before any comes at me saying the logos too dark, this is the washed black version not the black so the logo is supposed to be visible. I downsized to Medium and this thing is still huge but thats how it‚Äôs meant to fit. Ngl I was stressed ordering this after seeing the state of the recent Bound2 batches but I guess it‚Äôs hit or miss.

DO NOT ORDER. I had this jersey replaced 3 times and every time there was dye stains. I ended up spending more on replacement fees than the price of the jersey itself so I gave up on the third try. Can‚Äôt expect much for $5 but I would still avoid this seller.

yeezy,"Winter haul review (cp company palace puffer, fog, stussy, denim tears)","Palace x CP company puffer - This is the Holy thing of this haul, to be honest it is more expensive piece that any other I ever got, but I guess its really complex piece so the price is reasonable, for the quality I can say I am happy, I am not sure how it is supposed to be and how the material should feel but on touch its fine, main thing I was scared about was the level of puffiness or how the jacket will be puffed and its actually really puffy, when comparing to my retail 700 I could even say that this one is even more puffed, on the jacket there are many details inside that I cant really like rate as I never saw a retail or images on internet are not that detailed to see it, zip is smooth and its going smoothly up n down to full zip, and the googles are really cool detail that I love on the cp products, personally cant see myself wearing it fully ziped and with the googles on but w/e, for the price its a good piece if you like it, still the price is lower than any other retail puffers that you can buy at retail, will try to test it even like waterproofness etc and give a update as its ""expensive"" purchase and I went to ""risk"" but it was actually worth it, for sizing I cant really say as even S is bit oversized on me 

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=789999590342

Stussy jeans - they are same model but just different color, for comparasion with the denim tears they are baggier and just overally more wide but more simple, there is not much branding and its more simplier pair of jeans but still cool, mainly the fact they cost just around 30‚Ç¨ and the quality is pretty fine so if you just want it to add to your rotation go for it, for sizing I recommend sizing up but I personally wear a belt so I can have them more oversized

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=857496783048

Yeezy slides - I owned like 2 retails, I mean yea for the pcie its 100% worth it but you can actually feel the slide to not be that soft as retail, will see whats gonna happen after some use but at first try you can feel the difference, but yea they look literally the same and I would bet 99% of people could not tell a difference

https://weidian.com/fastorder.html?itemID=4939602503

caraartt jacket - this one is not winter jacket or anything like that so dont buy it to wear at winter beacsue you gonna freeze, but really happy with it, love how simple it is just little small logo on front and overally simple cool jakcet, when you full zip the thing around neck looks really fine, for fit I recommend taking true size as overiszed it might be really big on you, but there is a size chart on the store page

Denim tears jeans - as I mentioned before the fit is slimer and not that baggy, I took those as a gift for christmas and I was really trying to get at least the best batch possible or batch that look close to retail and its fine I think, the quality is good and the tears seems to be fine, again never owned a retail so cant really say and I dont even know to be fair what materail the tears should be but on touch they feel nice, there for sizing I recommend again checking chart as the fit might not be for everyone

Fear of god hoodie - I like it more than the essentials text so happy, its really comfy and the fit is oversized, pretty same as essentials but I would even say better, hood is big and its one of the more heavier hoodies I got, for sizing take a true size as its already oversized, graphic print seems nice quality but will see after a washes

yeezy,Yeezy boots from wwtop,"I just got home my Yeezy boots from wwtop and wanted to show what you get.
First of all I have not compared to retail in hand so take it with a grain of salt.
They do feel big
I usually go with 44,5 and went with 44 here, still feels too big.
The size tag is already peeling off on both shoes.
Quality seems to be fine, suede is alive but not the best, no glues stains or big inconsistencies.
Sole feels very solid, they do look very big tho, I‚Äôm not really a boot guy so was a bit of a shock for me.
Hope this helps in any wayü§ó

Product recommended by a boy: I usually wear a 44 but I took 2 extra sizes as consiglaito also from the seller (available on whatsapp). the quality is there but lose 0.5 because they are a little 'durette to the feet but read... with some use will definitely improve. for 13$ there are

9,5/10 really great material. I took a S because my bust is 99/100 cm and this bust measurement would be 104 cm but maybe a M (108 cm bust) would fit better... even if shoulders and length (body and sleeves) is perfect.. But it‚Äôs fine, I would wear it with only a shirt under. I tried it with a shirt under and I like it.. maybe a little tight but it‚Äôs ok!

REVIEW

What's up everybody and welcome to my first review, I'll try my best to describe my experience and any suggestion is much appreciated.

I apologize in advance for my english, and now let's talk about the haul:

‚Ä¢ Agent: AllChinaBuy

‚Ä¢ Shipping: EU Duty Free Air Cargo-B

‚Ä¢ Value added services: Simple packaging, Vacuum packaging

‚Ä¢ Special Requests: Fold shoe boxes 

‚Ä¢ Cost for the shipping: 89.93$ (after coupons)

REVIEW OF THE ITEMS

Nocta Sweatpants 24$ - these were for my friend, but honestly they're really good for the price: material feels really good, stitching is nice and there were no loose threads whatsoever, logo seems to be positioned correctly but lmk if I'm wrong. I'd really suggest these and I'll give a solid 9/10 for the price.

Louis Vuitton Belt 6$ - this was also also for my friend, i had ordered the same one but in white, so since he liked it much he decided to get one but black. There's really not much to say about this belt, of course don't expect to receive real leather for 6 dollars, but it's definetly crazy good for the price and it looks cool, you can't go wrong, so I'll give this an 8.5/10.

Carsicko Hoodie 12$ - another item for my friend (we ordered this haul together) and we did not expect this quality for only 12 dollars:
material is really heavy and it will keep you warm for sure, build quality wasn't even bad, too, we thought that maybe the logo was a slightly too big but that won't be a big deal since where we live not many people know Carsicko.
The only thing that was messed up were the laces at the bottom of the hoodie, the end of every lace was frayed and looked like it was unfinished, maybe a factory defect? maybe just this one hoodie? idk, but for that I'll rate this a 7.5/10, you can just fix that with some sewing at the end of the day. 

Amiri Belt 1.50$ - really nothing to say about this belt, for 1.50 dollars it's insane, we didn't have a real one to compare it to, but, again, it was less than 2 dollars, so we think it's really solid.
The synthetic leather didn't feel like pure plastic either, so this has to be a 9.5/10 just for the price.

Nike socks 1.20$ - I think you had to order at least 3 of these, anyways, they are really basic Nike long tube white socks, they feel very comfortable and, comparing them to my real Nike socks, I couldn't find any difference in looks/feels, so 10/10

Sp5der hoodie 16$ - this was a really budget-friendly one, I just searched for the cheapest but decent sp5der hoodie here on reddit.
I've never felt the real hoodie's puff print, but I feel like the one on mine could be a bit better, the material feels heavy and warm though, so that's a plus. The stitching also isn't bad by any means, but there was a little defect on the star on the center pocket, you can't really see it from normal distance though, and nobody would care anyways imo.
I'll give this a 7/10, decent for the price for sure.

LW batch Yeezy slides 17$ - I bought these from WWTOP, I wanted to keep things budget friendly so I ordered lw batch. I don't have real ones to compare these to but they are so soft and comfy, also the texture of slippers is kind of grainy ig, idk if it should be like that but anyways it's a 9/10 for the comfort.

KX/KZ batch AJ4 Pure Moneys 28$ - I've wanted these for so long and they finally arrived! This shoe is one of the best that KX batch produces, and you can see from the photos just how clean they look! 
Of course backtab pops back up quickly, toe box is fine, you have ""Pures"" written behind the backtab, the colors look good to me, and the cage also looks perfect. I'm going to keep these in their box and open them up as my Christmas present üòÑüòÉ.

This was all for this haul, I hope you liked the review and let me know if you have any questions, again, lmk if I missed something and I wish y'all a good day!

air jordan,[REVIEW] OWF Nike x Off-White Presto 2.0 from TMF,"Hi repfam!

I got the white prestos from TMF recently and wanted to give my honest review of the shoes + TMF's service.

I'm not an expert on this model but to me they look insanely good. I wanted these shoes since joining Fashionreps 4 years ago.

They fit TTS. I have EU45 in most shoes like Jordan 1's.
Get your regular size!

Supercomfortable and great quality.
I ordered the black version, direct shipping, yesterday and I will make a review about that later when I received them.

TMF ships FAST to agent. I purchased two pair of sneakers - Presto's and a pair of Air Jordan 4's(which I will not include right now)
Both was delivered within two days to my agent.

I paid 380¬• + 10¬• domestic shipping to agent.
They weight around 1200g with the shoebox.

I can highly recommend TMF, he is super helpful about everything if you'd like to know what batch to get and whatsoever.
He has direct shipping.
For the black pair of Prestos I paid 200¬• in shipping.

Here's a haul I've received with all the W2Cs as usual.

Jordan 3 AMM

I've been wanting a J3 for so long, I FINALLY bought one. I'm soooo pleased with it and can't wait to dress it.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432771521

Hermes bouncing

First of all I wanted to get the leather one haha but it's my fault I sent him the wrong one. In the end I'm not totally disappointed because this one is pretty cool.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454223555

New Balance 1000

I'd been wanting a New Balance 1000 for a while but couldn't decide on a colour. In the end I took this one, even if I realise that I should have taken another, I'm very happy with it. Never disappointed by the brand, always so comfortable.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454177591

Off white be right back 

To be honest, I'm a bit surprised, despite the fact that it's probably a batch that everyone has. The shape and comfort are very good. I recommend them!

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7456150304

Nike TL x Comme des Gar√ßons 

I already had the full white colourway and loved the pair. Unfortunately, me and white make two haha.So I took it back in this colour. I'm still just as happy with them, despite a few flaws. It's ok because that's not a very, very good batch.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7456182128

Chanel CC

Ilove the shoes and the way they look when worn, but honestly I don't think they're crazy. Let me know what you think. If you agree, then I recommend them.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454298263

New balance x Loro Piana

INCREDIBLE, I highly recommend it! The shape, the quality of the materials, the way they look when worn. I love it... even if retail is ‚Ç¨5000 haha.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432801143

Adidas Samba

Incredible, really! It's super clean, nothing to say about. My mom is very satisfied. I'm not a fan of the model, but it's so good that it's changed my mind.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435970552

Denim Tears x Stussy T-shirt 

Low grammage, so unfortunately it fits rather close to the body. It's not bad at all, because the t-shirt is pretty good.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454322453

Supreme Boxers

I'd already bought some in a haul, they're really good.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7445288572

AirPods Pro 2

As a comparison, I have the AirPods Max in retail, and for sure the sound quality and noise reduction is obviously not as good. However, it's still pretty good. I've used them 2/3 times when I'm too lazy to take my headphones, and it's really not bad.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434289624

Acne Studios T-shirt 

Very cool, good fit but very thin. Perfect for when it gets hot again.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454338389

Dior cardholder

It looks very good, but I don't think that the retail is the same. I gave it to my brother and he like it.

Thank you and I can provide w2c‚Äôs if there is a link that still exists, bear with me some of these are old as time.

#1: this large Alyx backpack has been my daily for the last 2 years and is such a quality backpack.  I have purchased 2 of the smaller bags from Grailed previously but this one can actually fit all my stuff for school lmao. 

#2: Salehe Bembury x crocs collab.  Holy mother of god, this has been my daily (as you can tell) wear to the gym and around the house.  I LOVE these shoes.  

#3: Unreleased Military Blue Fragment TS Low Jordan 1s.  These are absolutely my favorite pair of Travis‚Äôs im not a big fan of brown shoes so the other pairs never really did it for me.  W2C: https://k.youshop10.com/5WKVC3jB

#4: Fragment Design x Thunderbolt Project (Pokemon) Mew Plush (gimp??) I am so blown away with this thing, it was only $20 and it is the coolest plush ive ever seen.  I got the Pikachu one as well and it‚Äôs more like a regular one not leather, but I love the high quality of this thing and it‚Äôs huge.  W2C: https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=643109285241

#5: im putting together all my 4s and Air Yeezys in one bunch bc panda/acbuy finally let me cop some of these grails of mine.  W2C: Levi‚Äôs: https://k.youshop10.com/yrte1fiS
Yeezy: pandabuy link dead üíÄ
Snorlax 4s: same situation link ded 

#6: Pharrell ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù jeans Louis Vuitton: I love these jeans they r so fun, I was gonna put the basic black chrome jeans in this list but I got these 2 hauls back and have loved em since. W2C: https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=845612996712

#7: Bearbricks, I just got 2 of these in my last haul but I love them now, they r pretty cheap from China so I got a few before they will be harder to get. W2C: https://m.intl.taobao.com/detail/detail.html?id=742116542711&from=redirectFromAutoCallApp

#8: Nike Air Prestos x Off-White ‚Äúwhite‚Äù:  I loved these shoes so much that I bought a second pair.  Honestly some of the best reps I have found and I think they are mad comfy.  The ones on the right are after 3 years of wear and the others are brand new.  W2C: https://k.youshop10.com/ciojnihf

#9: LV Watercolor Knit Sweater: Unfortunately no W2C on this one but I think some sellers like 8billion have this if you dig deep enough on his Lv page.  But this was one item that really made me get into reps. 

#10: Rep closet - I def have spent more than I would have assumed at the beginning of this Rep adventure but I am very satisfied with all the items I have gotten and I wonder how going back to buying retail will be‚Ä¶. Anyhow with that I want to thank this community it‚Äôs been a good 5 years, and maybe see you soon if Trump can reinstate that shi. ",31,21,2025-04-27 20:03:48,FashionReps

Here's a haul I've just received, with all the W2Cs as usual.

Zip - 288CNY - Size M (TTS) 

I'd already had some a long time ago in black but in L, I loved it because the quality was great. So I got one in green in the right size.

T-shirt - 168CNY - Size M (TTS)

Almost 2 years ago, I bought some t-shirts from goat, and I was so disappointed that I didn't buy any more. But this one was so beautiful that I wanted to try again, and it's better, but not amazing.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435577593

Jordan x Cactus Jack x Fragment t-shirt - 178CNY - Size M (TTS)

I did a lot of research to find THE best and this one came up a lot, so I bought this one and it's crazy. Very very satisfied, and I've just received the j1 low X fragment, so it's perfect.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7437516766

Jordan x Cactus Jack T-shirt - 168CNY - Size M (TTS)

Ami Crewneck - 248CNY each - Size L (Size Up)

My cousin had already bought the beige one and was very happy with it, so he decided to get the same one in black. It's very, very good, so much so that I want to get one.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7406395757

Boxers - 148CNY - Size M (TTS)

The quality of the material is perfect, I feel like I'm wearing nothing at all, that's too comfortable.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7437486878

Stone Island Cap - 88CNY - Size L (One Size)

**- if pics wont work here:** [**https://imgur.com/gallery/3kg-haul-pics-WAoQ2lY**](https://imgur.com/gallery/3kg-haul-pics-WAoQ2lY)

‚Ä¢ if you would want QC pics let me know in the comments

**if you want to see more stuff check all the way down**

also before checking the photos i am really sorry for not updating the pics but the pics with the wooden floor were taken at the day of the opening , the other ones are the current ones after 2 months of use

**‚Ä¢ My Stats: 17 yo, 176cm, 73kg. Shoe size : 43-43.5**

( [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7161615777](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7161615777) )

\- in my opinion its not good because the material is not good , upclose it looks like polyester but the comfortability is not that bad just MID crewneck tbh.

\- rating: ¬†Accuracy 6/10 Quality 4/10 Comfort 7/10

**‚Ä¢ Brown Bathing Ape shirt / L / = 72 CNY**  
( link down )

\- for me it fits like small M even tho its L so if you want a good fit i would go up 1 if oversized fit go for 2 up but the link is down is it doesnt matter.

\- ¬†Accuracy 8/10 Quality 8/10 Comfort 7/10

**‚Ä¢ Nike SB Dunks AY version BLACK GRAY YELLOW RUBBER / 43 / = 230 CNY**

\- the shoes are really good and fits like regular SB Dunks. just great, but the only flaw that there is that the toebox doesnt go immediately up so thats the only downside but otherway really good budget pair. the comfortabily is not that good but not a single SB dunk is comfortable. i also got a free pair of grey laces which was a nice add.

\- rating: ¬†Accuracy 9/10 Quality 8/10 Comfort 7 /10

**‚Ä¢ All Black Air max 97s / 43 / = 200 CNY**  
( [https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4375130998](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4375130998) )

\- its from anonymous and the quality is on point, they are also really comfortable and for the money its definitely a must have. i walked 8 hours with them nonstop and they didnt hurt so its a really good budget pair. i also went to a official nike store where they had these there and couldnt notice a single flaw up to the small logo on the bottom of the shoe which is slighty darker but that is really it.

\- rating: ¬†Accuracy 9/10 Quality 9/10 Comfort 9 /10

**‚Ä¢ Carhartt Washed Zipper Hooded Jacket / M / = 270 CNY**

\- for the money the best jacket that you can buy, its really comfy and heavy. i rode a escooter while it was -2 celsius outside and was nice and hot in it so definitely recommending this. also compared it to my friends original piece which was thrifted and it was the exact same product . the only bad thing about it is that it does the wavy belly thing but that can be fixed by washing it or any other way.

air jordan,8kg haul to Greece üëª,"
---

Sneakers:

Jordan 4s (GX Batch) ‚Äì 9/10

True to size (TTS), but they fit slightly bigger due to the softer leather on the front compared to other Jordan 4 versions, like the Black Cats.

High-quality build with great comfort and fit.

I purchased a size 48.5 for myself and a 46 for my friend.
Link: https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7275858970

Nike Air Max 95 ‚Äì 7.5-8/10

Overall, a solid pair with good comfort‚Äîthough not the best in that department.

A minor flaw: slight stitching imperfections on the front, but nothing major.

The grip on the outsole seems excellent, making them potentially great for conditions requiring extra traction.

Link: https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7242221168

---

Clothing:

Trapstar Tracksuit (Full Set) ‚Äì 8/10

Purchased from GOAT (the seller).

The quality is impressive, but the pants run a bit smaller, especially for taller individuals.

Link:
https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7235083404

Trapstar Short-Sleeve Tracksuit ‚Äì 9.5/10

Also from GOAT.

Great fit, comfort, and style‚Äîalmost perfect, but I never give a full 10/10 because nothing is truly perfect.

https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7235108752

Underwear:

Calvin Klein Underwear ‚Äì 9/10

Comfortable and well-priced.

I don‚Äôt have much expertise in underwear, but they seem solid for the price.

air jordan,INHAND REVIEW (low karma) My first haul!,"Hello guys, welcome to my first haul ever! The package weighed around 7.5 kg and took 12 days to arrive in Italy. It included a jacket which I cannot mention here. I used Superbuy as my agent and paid 110 USD for shipping. This was back on January 10th.

My Stats:
Weight: 70 kg (155 lbs)
Height: 187 cm (6'1.62"")


1) Air Force 1 (Size 13)
üìå W2C https://shop1802771872.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=6362444292

For 20 USD, these are a steal! They are true to size (TTS), and I‚Äôve been wearing them a lot since I got them. No issues so far, but the material is definitely not the same as retail. I own a retail pair, and the material on these feels harder, especially on the front part.

2) GX Jordan 4 Military Black (Size 13)
üìå W2C https://weidian.com/item.html?itemId=6656410659

My first pair of Jordans ever, lol! I went TTS, and I struggle a bit to get my foot inside, but after some effort, it fits fine. I don‚Äôt feel any pain, even after walking for hours. Maybe it‚Äôs just the shape of the shoe. Inside, they feel very comfortable, and they look great. For sure, I‚Äôll order a different style again‚ÄîI‚Äôm really starting to like Jordans!

3) Supreme Dunks (Size 13)
üìå W2C https://weidian.com/item.html?itemId=6441025550

These are my favorite shoes from this haul! I love the aesthetic, they are TTS and very comfortable. Not much else to say‚ÄîI just love them.

4) Fendi Hat
üìå W2C https://weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7292256048

The hat is a little thin in my opinion, but it still looks good and provides decent warmth overall.

5) Palace Tracksuit from Tiger (Size M)
(No W2C, as it was a sale without restock. You might find different colors on his Yupoo. This one is from TigerRep.)

I love the aesthetic, but it‚Äôs a little short for my height. I can wear it fine, but it would have been better if it were longer. I already ordered a different Palace tracksuit from Tiger, this time in size L. It will definitely be baggier, but at least the length will be perfect for me.",9,6,2025-03-05 10:51:55,FashionReps

Agent: HubbuyCN

Estimated Weight: 8.7kg

Actual Weight: 9.6kg

Haul Items: (4 shoes , shoelaces)

Shipping line: FJ-US Actual Weight

Shipping Time: 23 Days Total, Submitted 1/19 Delivered 2/11

(delayed due to Chinese New Year, Cali fire)

Shipping Price: ¬•1074 Freight , ¬•6 Moisture Proof Bag , ¬•4 Stretch Film , ¬•5 Corner Protector, ¬•6 Bubble Wrap , ¬•31.15 Insurance ,¬†**Total ¬•1126.15 ($155.25 USD) ( had to pay another $20-$30 for fees)**

This is my first haul with HubbuyCN and I can say it was a pretty good experience, the website is pretty easy to use just copy & paste link in search bar and buy, all my items got to the warehouse within 4 days, I highly recommend this agent and I will do another haul with them.

¬†I did run into some problems though, using the website on phone is only good to get an freight estimation, for some reason I couldn't do that on computer but Id recommend using computer when ordering and accessing the site anyways, When I submitted my parcel I paid with PayPal what the total was and the next day I had to pay the remainder, and I had to pay a lot fees to even pay the rest cause I was forced to use my balance option($20-30) I don't know if that was a bug or what, I couldn't use a coupon I tried using all the ones I had from sign up link and not a single one worked kind of bummed I could have saved some extra cash. But I was at fault cause I could have talked to customer support and found a solution but I tried to get out right before CNY, this is my second time using an agent and I've noticed the price with this agent is way cheaper then the one I used previously, I do feel as direct would have been cheaper for me since my shoe size is a 13 and the shoes are a bit heavy and I would've gotten everything faster and for a bit cheaper.

air jordan,Winter Haul Review,"


**Intro:**

Hey everyone, long-time buyer, new reviewer. I did spend slightly more on shipping as it was shipped to Canada at the end of the Canada Post strike and just after the holiday season.

Would like to mention I'm not picky with logos and QCs. I obviously want the badges to look decent, but I'm also not the type to send back items 5 times trying to get a better product.

**Stats:**

* 6'3""
* 220lbs
* Muscular build

**Haul Details:**

* Shipping: $148 USD w/ Air Cargo (Special) to Ontario, Canada
* Weight: 7600g
* Submitted: January 2nd, 2025
* Received: January 11, 2025
* Total time in transit: 9 Days

**Items**:

# Canada Goose Wyndham (size: 2XL) 10/10

Bought from Top-Goosey. I contacted the seller about sizing and was told XL would fit, but I went with 2XL for room to layer with sweaters.

Sizing is great, and the sleeve length is perfect. The badge looks solid compared to my in-law‚Äôs retail CG. The jacket is very warm‚Äîperfect for Canadian winters. The fur looks good. I had to fluff it in the dryer with tennis balls, but that's normal.

Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=683653632666](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=683653632666)

# Nike x Supreme Corduroy Jacket (size: XL) 8/10

Since I bought the pants, I needed the matching jacket. It‚Äôs great quality and matches the pants well, even though they came from different sellers.

I find the matching set a bit bold to wear at the same time, so I usually wear either the jacket or pants. My only gripe is with the sleeves; they‚Äôre a little short for my build, and they pull up slightly when driving. Not a huge deal‚Äîjust a ""big boy problem.""

Link: [https://shop1707804864.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=5780103097&vc\_cps\_track=1459920903\_0\_0](https://shop1707804864.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=5780103097&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0)

# Nike x Supreme Corduroy Pants (size: XL) 10/10

I bought these as a Hail Mary, didn‚Äôt ask for pant length or waistband measurements. They fit great, have belt loops, and adjustable straps on each side to tighten them to your body. The branding on the back pocket is solid, and the Nike logo looks good on the front.

These have become my favorite pants. They go with pretty much anything. Although they look tapered in the photos, they aren‚Äôt. I'd say they fit like Supreme Baggy Jeans and cover enough of your shoes to get away with chunky ones.

Link: [https://shop1841501552.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7232134255&vc\_cps\_track=1459920903\_0\_0](https://shop1841501552.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7232134255&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0)

# Supreme Baggy Jeans (size: 34) 8/10

Bought these from Tiger, a staple in the rep community. I'm a 35 waist, and these fit fine. Only issue: when I bend down, the waistband digs into my stomach‚Äînot a big deal.

I went with 34 instead of 36 for length, and I'm glad I did. They cover my Jordan 4s but don‚Äôt drag in the snow. One front pocket button fell off, but I fixed it with a hammer.

Link: [https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=774314098121](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=774314098121)

# GX White Oreo Jordan 4s (size: 46) 10/10

These shoes were an annoying buy‚Äînot because of the seller but because I was trying to save money. Initially, I went with the VT batch. When it arrived at my warehouse, they looked decent, but the leather pattern was too noticeable. I decided to return them for a ""better batch.""

Then I went with the KX/KZ batch. These arrived with a yellow tinge to the sole and looked oxidized. I wasn't happy with them. Finally, I went with the GX batch from GXmade. These looked substantially better than the other batches. Long story short: buy the better batch in the first place.

These shoes are great‚Äîvery comfy from the moment I put them on. They pair well with any of the pants in this haul.

**Closing:**

Thanks for reading this lengthy review. Since it‚Äôs my first, I'll likely refine my presentation in the future. This post is for the taller and heavier guys out there‚Äîfinding things that fit can be hard, but options exist!

If anyone wants more detailed pictures, let me know, and I‚Äôll send them!

If you're wondering if it's worth it to buy from TMF,i'll say YES. He's in the trusted sellers list as i know and he also refunded me the difference between LJR and R1 batch.

FK batch. TMF

Quality: 9/10,  shoe feels really solid, short suede and rough suede feels really good as well. shoe feels really solid over all. only complaint is that the toe box does stick a little bit if you press down on it but no big deal. some parts of suede is a little flat but nothing a brush can't fix. overall not much complaints and I am really happy. Came with 2 bandanas and 2 extra laces. 

Comfort: 7/10, padding is good but it's nothing special, pretty stiff but i haven't worn them much so it should break in. 

Sizing: go down a size or half size they fit pretty big to be. ",5,2,2025-01-09 18:14:59,FashionReps

Quality: 10/10, I have no complaints, leather was soft and buttery. the outdated backtab and toe box test passed easily. tongue and ankle padding js good as well as both tongue tags. really solid, good sturdy sole. GX quality you can expect, loved the pair

 Comfort: 8/10, obviously not the most comfortable shoe but theyre 4s so itll be like that. they felt snug and nice.

Sizing: TTS, felt snug but not tight as a US10

air jordan,"AJ 4 ma maniere wyws - By shark Breeder
","I purchased, in my opinion, one of the best AMM Jordan 4s from Shark Breeder, featuring a lighter and more versatile colorway. With the GX batch, they‚Äôve done an extraordinary job, with details that come very close to 100% of the retail version.

# Key Details:

* Color and Materials: Virtually identical to retail, with minor differences in the leather on the toe box and the side mesh, which are easily adjustable. They can be paired with almost any outfit, both male and female.
* Shape: Height and proportions are faithfully reproduced, with the toe box and cage showing only slight variations that are irrelevant overall. Almost impossible to spot as replicas.
* Heel and Tongue: Small differences in color and finish on the ""Nike Air"" logo and the tongue label, but only noticeable upon close inspection by an expert with a legit check.
* Accessories and Packaging: The box and extra laces are nearly perfectly reproduced.

Purchased through an agent. An excellent choice for anyone seeking quality and fidelity to the original model.

In my opinion, the price is fair, considering that other batches on the market have visible flaws in almost all of the areas mentioned above. Initially, they feel a bit stiff, but with daily wear, they break in comfortably.

W2C Seller:¬†[allchinabuy link](https://www.allchinabuy.com/en/page/buy?from=search-input&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D6102514919)[üì∑](https://finds.ly/product/WEIDIAN/6102514919?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D6102514919)¬•41018 sold\[New GX Green x Version\] Foreign Trade Designated Batch Extranet  
Price: 350 yuan.

# Conclusion:

I believe GX remains the best batch for Jordan 4 replicas, delivering results that verge on perfection.

Shark Breeder ‚Äì always reliable!

Ranking:
1. North face
Best item in the haul by far fits TTS. It‚Äôs super comfy and super padded on the inside. Had me sweating in about 5 minutes of wear which is perfect for this nyc weather. Also came with the best accessories and a little carry bag for it

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7290214404&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0

2.  Nocta Tech Fleece
Although simple it‚Äôs very comfy and fits TTS. I own the original tech fleece and it‚Äôs made out of that same material very comfy to chill in.

3. Saint Micheal Hoodie
This thing is an absolute beast weighing in at 1800g. Insanely heavy and comfy to wear, super cool designs and art styles all around the hoodie. Issue is that it‚Äôs massive so size down 1-2 times.

4. Ascics Gels
Never had a pair before so I hopped on the band wagon and ordered me a pair. I‚Äôm not kidding when I say it felt as if I was walking on air. Super duper comfy fits TTS only think I don‚Äôt like is how reflective it is but if that‚Äôs an issue for you just go with all black or a diff color way.

5. Revenge Varsity Jacket
Super cool design and high quality material only issue is it smells like the broken dreams of my agent so if anyone knows how to remove that smell lmk asap.

6.  Birkenstock Boston
Very comfy fits slightly big like 0.5 bigger. But this with a pair of oversized jeans is a match made in heaven.

7. Travis Scot‚Äôs 
Both pairs are really good quality in my opinion. The suede on the mochas is super soft and move. If anyone catches anything wrong lmk cause I didn‚Äôt qc em. Full trust in pika fits TTS.

8. Chrome heart hoodies
Very good quality materials comes with the tags and all. Was looking ages for these particular hoodies and I‚Äôm glad I found em, fits TTS.

9. Jordan 1 Chicago
Don‚Äôt get it mistaken, just because it‚Äôs at the bottom doesn‚Äôt mean theirs anything wrong with it. It‚Äôs very high quality it just doesn‚Äôt have anything worth calling home for. It‚Äôs a great shoe that‚Äôll get the work done fits TTS.

https://k.youshop10.com/beNmkvq0

Overall
Very happy with everything agent I used was SuperBuy. Took a bit to come since holiday delays but that‚Äôs just the way things go.

Last week, I got my order from¬†[r/Superbuy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superbuy/)¬†\#superbuyhaul

**A few notes upfront:**

* I paid around 70$ per pair (airpods) and 30$ for AJ4.
* I don't own a retail pair but had a chance to compare them.

**Air pods max:**

* **Build quality:**¬†Compared to the retail version, it‚Äôs pretty bad. It feels like it could break in my hands.¬†**4/10**
* **Sound quality:**¬†Shockingly, it‚Äôs even better than the original. The sound feels rich, clear, and balanced ‚Äì honestly, a perfect¬†**10/10**.
* **ANC (Active Noise Cancellation):**¬†There‚Äôs absolutely no ANC at all ‚Äì none. It‚Äôs completely missing.¬†**0/10**

It‚Äôs probably worth investing more money in a better batch because people could tell it was a rep.

**Air Jordan 4:**

* **Design:**¬†Iconic and timeless, they stand out while remaining versatile.
* **Comfort:**¬†Better than expected for such a classic sneaker, suitable for daily wear.
* **Overall rating:**¬†Perfect for style and practicality 8/10.

Overall:

I have to say, ordering through¬†**SuperBuy**¬†was a great experience! The process was smooth, and everything was handled efficiently.

* **Shipping:**¬†It was surprisingly fast, considering the price I paid. The package arrived quicker than I expected.
* **Ease of Use:**¬†The platform was easy to navigate, and placing the order was straightforward.
* **Overall Experience:**¬†I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with how well everything went.

I‚Äôll definitely be ordering through SuperBuy again in the future! Highly recommended.

# Total: 640¬• + shipping 480¬• = 1120¬• = ~150 euro

# Quality: All pairs seem to be well made. My foot size is around 44 - 44.5 EU, but 45 fits very good as well.

Seller was very responsive, communication was clear and fast, helped me out if I had any questions. Shipping took around \~11-12  days to Baltic States.

All in all, I think this is the best source so far for my sneakers. I'm one of those people that don't like the Dunks, Jordans & such, as everyone wears them and I just can't stand them.

Big thanks to GOD, thought it'd take forever to get my shipment but it came twice if not more faster than my first order on PandaBuy three years ago.

air jordan,Travis scott reverse mocha PK. one year after purchase. Review,"Review of my PK batch travis reverse mochas. These have been my beaters for a long time now and i could not be more happy with them. I mostly use them in the garage now. 

These shoes seemed a bit expensive for me at first (70$ ish) considering other batches are almost 50% cheaper. What i will say is that its 100% worth it to pay more for a better batch. These shoes have held up extremely well, ive used them thru the Swedish winter, even going hiking in them at one point. 

Of course they are beat as hell but that would happen with any shoe. The only minor flaws for me is that the leather started cracking in the toebox and also some sole separation (also toebox area). Other than that all materials have held up suprisingly well. 

In conclusion i would definitly buy again! Rekommend. I also think toebox cracking might be solved in the never versions of this batch not sure tho!

asics,"5KG Haul to Australia - Acne studios, Jjjjound Asics, Stussy","Stats: 177cm 72kg (sorry for terrible photo)

Acne studios 1981 Jeans: Very high quality, materials feels really nice. Fit is a bit long but but purchase according to waist size. 9/10 (I got size 46):¬†[https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=843692793949&ali\_trackid=2:mm\_117358474\_33384934\_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.a476f69&mt=](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=843692793949&ali_trackid=2:mm_117358474_33384934_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.a476f69&mt=)

Jjjjound Asics: High quality, material seems decently close to retail. Some stitching is a bit rough, fits TTS. 8.5/10:¬†[https://shop1633363540.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7295308320&vc\_cps\_track=1459920903\_0\_0&vc\_cps\_track=1459920903\_0\_0&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c74addf](https://shop1633363540.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7295308320&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c74addf)

Supreme MM6 Zip (Black from MVT): Very very high quality. Stitching and distressing looks 1:1 to retail. 10/10 (Bought size S):¬†[https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=839576304944&ali\_trackid=2:mm\_117358474\_33384934\_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.82da483](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=839576304944&ali_trackid=2:mm_117358474_33384934_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.82da483)

Supreme MM6 Zip (Grey from Tiger): I was originally going to buy from MVT but he told me it would take over a month to ship‚Ä¶ This item took 1 day to arrive at the warehouse. Overall, very impressed. I will say however, the cotton on the interior of the jacket is not the same material as MVT, it does feel a little off. The distressing is also not as accurate as retail. Although, if you are considering getting from Tiger, I would recommend it, but it you have the extra money, you can also decide to go for MVT. 9/10 (Bought size M, lowkey could‚Äôve gotten S)¬†[https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=781565650350&ali\_trackid=2:mm\_117358474\_33384934\_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c9885e2](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=781565650350&ali_trackid=2:mm_117358474_33384934_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.c9885e2)

Acne Studios Shirt: Kind of a rushed purchase but genuinely one of my favourite pieces to wear. It fits nicely and have a oversized-ish sort of fit. The material feels genuinely so nice and doesn‚Äôt degrade in the wash. 9.5/10 (Bought size S, highly recommend)¬†[https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=704310619724&ali\_trackid=2:mm\_117358474\_33384934\_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.bfc05dd](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=704310619724&ali_trackid=2:mm_117358474_33384934_118778578&spm=1101.1101.N.N.bfc05dd)

asics,"2kg haul thats been left in warehouse for 80 days (asics, oakley, stone island/supreme)","This haul was way over due and I dont know why i kept it in the warehouse for so long and I feel as though it contributed to some of the problems I faced with it 

Shipped with EMS before tariffs, costed around $71

Kept in warehouse for around 80 days


Asics Gel Nyc - 6.7/10, The flagship of the haul turned out to be a letdown, as the sizing was not tts. I ordered a size 10 on accident and meant a 10.5 but had it completely weird; they were obviously too narrow but what I wasn't expecting was that they would be too long for me, and when I ran in them for ~5 my feet were sliding around in them. Materials feel fine, they are slightly translucent because of how breathable they are. Foam and cushioning seem good, comfy, but I couldn't wear them. The shoes come from a known seller and people have had good experiences with them, yet im not sure if its a defect with my shoes or the fact they were left in a warehouse for 80 days before shipping, but I cannot vouch for them.

Oakley Glasses - 8/10, The glasses feel like a reskin of some cheap gas station glasses. Seem to work as how cheap gas station glasses would. Details are present, but the case smells like üí© and have appeared to make the glasses smell resonate its smell. Most likely because theyve been trapped in the warehouse for 80 days, but the case seems to be the root cause. Case seems alright, on one of the glasses cases the oakley logo is not centered but the zipper feels good and is not sticky. The glasses smell much less but not totally odorless, but its a very small ammount. I washed my glasses in hot water and dish soap. The smell is probably the rubber. Overall not that bad but dont expect anything great.

Stone island X Supreme ski mask - 10/10, Love this thing, high quality, no smell despite being in the warehouse, cheap, thick, luminescence works as expected. Going to take this skiing indoors and will make a review on how it holds up

Overall haul 7/10 - idk its small and kind of a let down

asics,ASICS Kayano 14 X JJJJound Silver Black - ZC - YOLO - ¬•240 in hand.,"
I just received these Kayano 14s in hand from Yolo and am very pleasantly surprised.
These are the ZC batch which generally with ASICS and New Balance are the best batch out there being very close to retail versions.

These early 2000s mesh runners are one of the most popular shoes on the market at the moment making a revival as people are preferring to wear a comfortable shoe rather than one that looks good but is very uncomfortable for walking around all day.

I went true to size and they fit perfectly. Normally I go up half a size in Nile‚Äôs and Jordan‚Äôs as I have a slightly wider foot. Looking at retail pictures I‚Äôd have to say they nailed this shoe. They look very accurate from the gel material to the mesh and cuts.

I gotta say walking around all day in these they are super comfortable. I would highly recommend these to anyone. I‚Äôm sure if you get a pair it will quickly become the shoe you leave next to from door and chuck on when you go out. Also at ¬•240 they are very affordable.

Asic Gel NYC-  I rate these a 9/10 I don‚Äôt see anything off about them. Maybe just the ‚ÄúGEL‚Äùon the back of the shoes being a little crooked but nothing major. They are comfortable I‚Äôve been wearing them to work for the past week no complaints. I went TTS and they fit fine.

Link- https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7312316231&ref=200331900

Carhartt Jeans- I give these a 7/10 only because of the factory smell coming off of them is insanely strong. They feel nice for the price and you can‚Äôt really go wrong with them. I went with the largest size (I like my stuff baggy) and I like how they fit. (Came with Carhartt tags)
Link- https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=ali_1688&id=845225146226&ref=200331900

Ralph Lauren Polo zip ups- I would rate these a 6/10 only because the material on the 2 hoodies are different and they both are the same size but the black one fits smaller than the navy and the black ones logo is a little more visually off imo.

asics,"Finally spring type haul(supreme, stussy, palace, arte, protect, ascics)","Shipped with superbuy and used DHL to EU as always

Protect shorts - Last summer I got bigboy jorts from this seller and was really happy with them and the quality was fine and tis is same thing, 
those r shorts so they fit little shorter as I got bored of jorts beeing too long, denim is fine and mainly its not hard so wearing it feels fine, the whole bradning on this piece is embroided and really minimalistic I think, love them but for size there I sized up once as I think protect have smaller sizing

stussy shorts - Just small branding on pocket and hardly tell that its stussy but still cool, mainly the quality is really good an the color is fine, little bit shorter than the protect but I also took size smaller becasue of the waist size on stussy beeing actually normal size, material is fine just totally simple shorts and mainly the fit is great so its worth the 30$

supreme jeans - As I am writing this I just got that many items are totally minimalistic, denim is fine and mainly the fit is really cool, they r baggy and I took my true size and its really good

Arte cardigan - Material and quality is fine, not really my style. I get this weird feeling when wearing something that is not oversized or dirty but still cool, it fits cropped but I still recommend taking true size as I cant really imagine how it would look when it would be oversized, and the embroidery on the front is really smooth when you touch it

palace carhatt tee - I really like the design so I got in both colors, the tee is thick so its not see thru mainly talking about about the white one, print is fine and I recommend taking size up for oversized fit 

asics - Really light shoe, wanted some cooler color and I think I delivered witht this, material is I think fine not rally an expert into those shoe material but I think they will last, but still I feel free to totally destroy them this summer ;) I took same size as for my afs and it fits fine so if you stick with this price you should be fine

stussy denim tears tee - bit weird collab I think but the tee is fine material is okey and the fit is also fine but I sized up there and I did the right thing

Palace needles tee - This is not your normal palace tee material I cant really its some type of towel material ig but is really comfortable, I again reocmmend taking size up a for more oversized fit and its really good, mainly the details there as the butterfly have some spaces that the emrboidery need to skip and its really clean, I can recommend this one, there is also one in white that I will get

random jeans - the shape of them is little different than the supreme ones, they are like straight so the bottom is more wide I maybe even like this fit more but why cant supreme do this also I need the small logo on back pocket, material is fine but maybe the sizing is little smaller as its from some CN shop

dirts white jeans - same as the one before but the overall design is different haha, I personally like the dirty effect and I think it makes your jeans cooler but would appriciate if the dirty wash could be even of the bottom",561,39,2025-03-27 10:20:19,FashionReps

Stats: 185cm and 75kg, I wear eu 47.5. 

Been loving the asics lineup atm and the comfort recently so I got this pair for a pretty cheap **180 cny** (24usd).

The black Asics stripes and silver detailing are sharply defined. No noticeable misalignment or fading in the logos. No major quality issues such as glue stains, stitching errors, or panel misalignment. The final in-hand pair is very close to the QC photos, with minor visual differences due to lighting. 

Comfort wise it fits tts no bs asian sizing like the clothing. GO TTS for the same size u wear for M and top batch dunks, or LJR j1s

asics,"(Reveiw) 6KG MuleBuy Haul to United States (New Balance x Stone Island, Palace, Asics, ON Runner,  Noah NYC, Carhartt, Kith, Ect)"," **Stats**

Height: 5'9""

Weight: 210lbs

**MuleBuy Review (9/10)**

My Experience with Mulebuy was actually pretty great! Everything was ordered quickly, QC and photos were uploaded fats, and the shipment left their warehouse within 24 hours of my paying for shipping. The only complaint I have is that the shipping rates seemed a bit higher than others. This package with EMS30 to the United States cost me $125USD after applying their shipping coupon. Delivery was only 12 days which blew me away! Package was well protected and everything was wrapped up very nicely.

**Stone Island x New Balance 991's / ZH Batch (10/10) $37.49 USD W2C:**[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7233853817)

This was the item I was most excited about. These were the ZC President batch so I had high expectations. Once in hand, I was blown away by how nice the materials were. The small details are just perfectly done. This is a shoe I would recommend getting the higher quality batch of. The fit of the shoe is a little big. I'm a weird fit between 10.5/11US and I bought an 11. I would recommend going that half size down.

**On Runner Coudswift 3 / Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (10/10) $10.30 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7310988159)

I'm going to be honest, I had insanely low expectations for these shoes. I bought these for my girlfriend who wears ON Runner and Hokas daily. She put them on and they fit and feel exactly like her other few pairs of On Runners. She asked me to buy a handful more so she doesn't have to buy anymore for a while. These fit true to size. I'm not an expert on these shoes but I would give a perfect score especially for the price.

**New Balance 2002R Black Protection Pack/ Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (5/10) $10.45 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7310115295)

These shoes are one of two things in this haul I don't really like. These were only $10 so I really aint worried about them. I'll just end up using these as beaters. The shoe fits fine but the color is very off and the overall build of the shoe just seems off. I don't have much more to say about it. It's ight!

**Asics Gel-NYC Graphite Grey/ Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (9/10) $8.96 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7310121913)

I'm a huge fan of Gel/NYC's and have a handful in my collection already. The quality of the shoe is pretty damn good. The only complain I have is the fit is decent but the toe box seems a little longer than my models. I will wear them and use them without issue but I would size down a half size. Great colorway I wouldn't normally buy but like it.

**Aime Basketball Hat / TSARCHIVE (9/10) $8.21 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=734920065504)

This hat is a great sleeper piece! This hat for the price is top notch. The yellow weather is very well done and the fit is good even for my big ass head. The only complaint I have is the bottom lettering is a ever so slightly crooked. You would only notice it if you stare at it but I don't mind.

**Kith Beanie / Martin Reps (10/10) $11.65 USD W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7318042557)

You ever buy something and you're excited at the time and when you get it, you just don't care. This is one of those items! The quality of the piece is good but its a little too small for my big ass head. My girlfriend likes the look so she's gonna take it.

**Carhartt White Beanie / Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (8/10) $2.69 USD W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7303769949)

I bought this for shits and giggles. Its was a random hat and it ended up being a Carhartt Beanie. It's not my exact style so as some of the other things, I'll pass it along to my girlfriend.

**Carhartt Socks / (5/10) $1.91 USD (Each) W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653734124147)

This review has a catch. One pair of socks is excellent and one pair of socks is straight ass cheeks! They are from the same seller, same listing, but two different color options. The one with the gold logo is nice and thick and fits great. The one with the black Logo is as thin as paper and the logo is stitched on crooked. You take a gamble on this one.

**Palace x Oakley Black T-Shirt / 37-Tide (10/10) $14.78 USD W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=705204955550)

Most people know the quality of 37-Tide is excellent so I wasn't worried at all. Shirt fits like a normal Palace shirt. Shirt is thick and the print feels excellent. Would recommend this for anyone looking for Palace pieces. Sorry for the terrible photo as my phone doesn't pick up black well.

**Noah NYC Core T-shirt / Pharoah AKA (10/10) $16.24 W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=669727984613)

I'm a huge Noah NYC fan and have tons of pieces already so it was easy to compare. This is a great replica of a classic Noah T-shirt. Nice and heavyweight. Tags look good. Print feels excellent. No complaint from me at all!",63,33,2025-01-19 20:37:11,FashionReps

asics,CSSBUY Waste of time?,"All my branded items are cancelled by cssbuy

So im new to using cssbuy. Superbuy has been the one since panda left RIPüêº. Shipping cost were so high on superbuy i paid 10euros an item last time so i wznted to find a cheaper shipping agent and the shipping on cssbuy was a lot cheaper. I locked in to buy some new shoes and I found some nice pairs from different sellers but cssbuy cancelled all my orders üòü. I can order these in superbuy just not css. How common is it to get my orders cancelled, am I doing something wrong? Isn't branded items the biggest reason agents exist? What am I missing?

If this is the usual on cssbuy I'm gonna have to leave this agent behind because I can't buy the items I use Chinese agents for üòîüòî

asics,15kg Superbuy Haul to Canada,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm back with another review to start off the year! This haul was shipped using the Ocean route special provided by Superbuy and I received it after 34 days. The shipping fee for this haul was 546 yuan.

I got a lot of Stussy pieces but some of the links are dead or out of stock OOS. I‚Äôll try to update the links if I find from yupoo sellers such as akdingji or mook official.

STATS: 180cm 82kg Waist 32

Stussy Ripstop Puffer Jacket: Got this from Sweet potato after returning a couple bad ones, and the quality is really good. The logo on the jacket is well embroidered, has a large hood and two wide inner pockets. The jacket feels so light and it has adjustable hood and hem. I got this in size Large fits tts

Stussy International Print Hoodie: This hoodie is so soft, just perfect to chill in and I got this from Langwei fairy. When compared to retail pics, the print looks smaller and placement a bit higher. Besides that, it‚Äôs still a good hoodie. I got this in a size Large fits tts.

Stussy Shell Wave Dye Jacket: Just a good shell jacket I bought from Three T. Logo print looks good to me, nice wave dye print and deep pockets. I should have sized up on these as I got this in a size Medium and the arms are shorter.

Supreme Knit Sweater: Such a nice piece from Dragonreps the knit material feels really good. The sweater is also thick, and the small box logo is well done. I got this in a size Large fits tts.

Stussy Crackle Print Sweatshirt: Clean sweatshirt bought from Three T. It has a boxy fit, fleece-lined but it‚Äôs not that heavy. Probably go a size up for baggy fit because of the cropped length. I got mine in a size Large

Supreme Distressed Loose Denim: Nice heavy wash denim both in blue and black from Dragoreps. Both denim jeans have a straight loose fit so maybe go a size up for baggy fit. I got this in a size 32

Stussy Indigo Denim: Great quality denim from Dragonreps again, I really like the color on this one, tts baggy fit. The logo on the back tab should be darker like 3madman‚Äôs batch which is also cheaper. I got this in size 32/M as well.

Stussy Light Wash Denim: Good light wash baggy denim from 3madman, he also has other colors all at a good price. I got mine in a size 32 

Stussy Python Pants: Nice wide printed pants bought from Three T. The python print looks clean, logo embroidery on the back is also well detailed. I got this in a size Large

Stussy Realtree Pants: Seen a lot of these pants with faded prints, but I bought these from i795 instead. The realtree print is so well detailed and colorful, I still haven‚Äôt seen the jacket to match this quality. I got these in a size 32

Stussy Needlepunch Camo Pants: Same as the realtree pants, I had to return a couple of bad prints till I found these from Sweet potato. The quality of the pant is good and logo on the back is well embroidered. Mook also has this but it‚Äôs more expensive. I got mine in a size 32

Asics JJJJound Gel-Kayano 14: Took a long time but we finally got these in larger sizes from WWTop and it looks better than the market batch. I got this in a size 46 fits tts. 

Nike Air Max 95 Neon: I always wanted to get a pair of these but not Umkao‚Äôs batch. After the wait and long essays, WWTop finally drops the GX batch and it looks insanely good. Got this in a size 46 fits tts. 

Stussy Martin Rose driving gloves: Gloves look good to me. One size fit 

ERD accessories: All purchased from the same seller Coar star, good and affordable selection. 

Stussy SS link belt: Thin studded belt from Mystic garden, good quality only in size S/M

Martin Rose cut peak cap: Cool style of hat, logo embroidery looks good as well.

Supreme boxers: Good quality boxers from Baymax army green and grey. 

Camo skull cap: Good fleece lined cap.

asics,"8KG Mulebuy Winter Haul (Essentials, Asics, Dior, Canada Goose) (Links In Comments)","Bit late but here‚Äôs a few shi i copped for Christmas üéÑ . My bad on the insane lighting in some pics ‚ò†Ô∏è as you can already tell they were taken at different times in the day üò≠ A year ago now, I did a review on KOG‚Äôs Supplier for his Canada Goose Wyndham Red Badge and it done really well so you KNOW i had to get the black badge version to review for y‚Äôall. King of Goose‚Äôs Yupoo is claiming the jackets got updates so let‚Äôs test that theory. I still have both so lmk whether you guys want a comparison or just in-depth?

Asics Gel Kayano 14 ‚ÄúBlack White Silver‚Äù
Skeptical to buy at first as it‚Äôs become a popular shoe so quick and i didn‚Äôt think sellers could replicate it so well so soon.
They feel really good on the feet and give you an extra boost in height. I‚Äôd say that these are TTS and a must buy for anyone interested i‚Äôd give these a 8.5/10



Dior B30 ‚ÄúDA4‚Äù
These shoes came from Koala, which i have bought from before. Just as i expected amazing quality. Really was surprised by the price as i expected it to be $100+ but it came in at just under $80 which is great value for the quality you get. Didn‚Äôt add pictures of the add ons to keep the haul pictures short but i got extra laces, dust bag and a Dior shopping bag which is great customer appreciation üò≠ I would give these shoes a 9/10


Essentials SS22 Dark Oatmeal/Black

I made a post a while back on an Essential s Supplier that i believed it was for Singor. Got this info from a Discord Mod in the PDB Discord back in the day and decided to check it out and share the info with others like he did shout out to bro üëä. When i made the post back then i couldn‚Äôt really judge the quality that much as it was a qc but i can say now that i have it in hand. It was a reliable source and it really did live up the expectationsüôå. For the price of $24 which Singor would sell for only ‚Äúhis‚Äù Essentials bottoms is an ABSOLUTE STEAL. I swear this seller deserves the night of their lives üò≠üôè. As soon as i put it on i felt electricity through my body. One thing tho i will have to say is that PLEASE don‚Äôt make the same mistake i did. ALWAYS CHECK THE SIZE CHART‚ÄºÔ∏èThis goes for anything when it comes to ‚Äúrep‚Äù clothing as most sellers have a chart in their product description or yupoo anyway. 1st time i bought the tracksuit i ordered the wrong size and had to send it back to exchange for a smaller size. If i‚Äôm being honest i‚Äôm not sure whether i can say this is TTS as i have sizing trouble when it comes to clothes. Sometimes i can fit Size Small or Medium so i can‚Äôt say with certainty that it will be TTS for you. Best thing to do is as i‚Äôve mentioned before is to use the size chart. Find clothes in your house that fit you well and measure them and try to find the closest stats to what matches the chart. But now, for the rating I would have to give these Essentials sets a score of 9.5/10 

KOG Supplier - Canada Goose Wyndham Black Badge 
I ain‚Äôt gotta say too much as i‚Äôm gon save it for review coming soon üòâ just know that the jacket is good as hell. 

Chill lil haul appreciate y‚Äôall for reading this far ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• lmk what typa review yall want for the Canada Goose or any other item here yall wanna see in detail ‚úåÔ∏è

[Salamon XT6: Insanely comfy and good quality. I wasn't expecting them to be waterproof but they suprisingly are. comfiest shoe I own insanely cushioned sole. The listing said to size up once or twice so I bought a 47 when im usually a 45\/46 and they fit perfectly for me. Misleading size and I have wide feet so a lot of shoes are awkward for me to wear but these are great. 8\/10](https://preview.redd.it/xxujkgj0ms9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e501449c4bcddcbefa16ac84b0a9c14cf1af765)

[Asic Gel Nyc: Really good quality for the price no flaws that I have seen personally. Super comfy to wear although the sole is slightly more solid than usual making them slightly less comfortable side by side with retail but still a great shoe. 9\/10](https://preview.redd.it/65jk3xw8ms9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922dae9996261bb6cabd26268d9122957e0eed18)

[Acne studios belt: For the price I have no complaints, the belt itsself is good quality and the Acne studios logo is good quality metal and not flimsy. Not real leather but I wasn't excpecting that for the price.

[Margiela Tee: Crazyyyyy quality for the price. Better than a lot of t shirts that I payed 100+ for. T shirt is 100&#37; cotton which is always nice and the print is 1:1 from what i can tell. Tags are perfect and the fit of the T shirt is great \(oversized and slightly boxy\).

[Acne studios 2023m paint splatter jeans: Highlight of the haul for me as i've wanted these for such a long time. the fit on them is insane and they're 1:1 although slightly shorter compared to retail. stitching on the jeans and around the patch is very good quality and 1:1. I've got a pair of acne jeans from topacney and side by side the topacney jeans have much better quality and more accurate size chart for only 4 euros price difference. Although the size chart is not perfect they actually fit me better than retail because they are slightly shorter.  They are good quality denim and are my favourite piece in my whole closet. Everything said still a 10\/10 for me. ](https://preview.redd.it/zsw8eb8jrs9e1.jpg?width=3022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37fae83c8c743f029648f27b568dd5e8d11f495b)

[Firerep oversized blank hoodie: craziest hoodie in my closet in terms of quality and thickness. Its made with very nice material so its the perfect balance between heavy weight but not like wearing a weighted blanket. A lot of heavyweight hoodies can be droopy but this fits perfectly and has a very nice shape. The inside material is the softest i've ever felt on a hoodie. The hood is double layered so has a very nice structure that is maintained whilst wearing. 10\/10 my current fav hoodieamazing for the price. ](https://preview.redd.it/lk6du6zass9e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a06336902bfd28fb49394e54836d9bc235fabe42)

asics,"11KG Joyabuy Haul, some cool finds üòÑ","Hi everyone,

I just wanted to share my experience with the amazing experience ive made with JoyaBuy. I've been using CssBuy for a while, but unfortunately, they no longer purchase branded products unless the brand is censored by the seller. While searching for a new agent that buys branded products, I discovered JoyaBuy‚Äîand I couldn't be happier!

First off, they purchase your order from the seller very quickly, and their support team is incredibly responsive and answers any questions in no time. Additionally, my order arrived in just 14 days! The shipping costs were also very reasonable‚Äî160 euros for 11,4 kg, which I thought was fantastic.

I highly recommend JoyaBuy to anyone looking for a reliable new agent. They‚Äôre absolutely amazing!

asics,4KG MULEBUY HAUL,"First of all Ill be talking about mulebuy service. They are taking a bit longer to qc your items and store them. I dont know if it is because of the ,,moving‚Äô‚Äô or they just have less people working in the warehousu. Quality of pics is pretty good but I wish there were more photos of shoes when ordering. After I submitted the shipping It took them about 4-5 days to ship my package. It isnt that bad but always could be better. To sum up I give Mulebuys stuff 7/10.

Shipping took around 12 days to Slovakia thorough DHL. Everything went smoothly. I did get updates on everything so thats a positive thing.

I wanted to change the reviews of the products so I made a few fits with the items I got. There are items from the other hauls also. (I know I was using just 1 pair of jeans but It is for something, dont judge).

I ordered 3 pair of shoes, 2 t-shirts and 1 cap.

Timberlands- they are just beatiful. I love them so much. Quality is very good, Size down tho. 10/10 (Link: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6702838806)

Asics Gel-Kanyano 14 ‚Äòclassic red‚Äô - I love the colorway so much. Im thinking of getting another pair in the other cw. I dont know if the tags are correct but who is gonna legit check asics on your feet. The fit small so go one size up definitely. 10/10(The link is dead i dont know why but ther are from YOLO)

CDG Nike 95s - These are for friend. I dont know of the quality is good or no. They are PE batch. Cant compare the quality to anything but they seem very nice to me 8/10(Link: https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7242507540)

Washed T-shirt - The quality is pretty good for 7‚Ç¨. It fits well. Maybe go size down if u domt want it oversized. Dont have anything else to say, just plain shirt. 8/10 (Link: https://detail.1688.com/offer/755161609987.html)

Stussy 8ball T-shirt - Good quality of the print and of the blank. Basic stussy shirt with good quality. If you like stussy then vet this piece. 9/10 (Link: https://shop1621999129.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7230769966)

Fitted Cap - I saw on the seller page there were some new styles of caps so i have to got one. I have to say these are good ash. They fit nice, doesnt smell. For 4‚Ç¨ it is a must have 10/10 (Link: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=765269215876)

This is my 3rd haul with Mulebuy and I am pleased with them. Service is pretty good, they are reliable and allow ,,restricted items‚Äô‚Äô. Everything went smoothly, hopefully they will speed up their process of storing items.

new balance,PART 1/2 HUGE HAUL ALL FROM TIGERREP,"
Everything from here :
 https://tiger-official.x.yupoo.com/albums?page=1

Just received a big haul from TigerRep and wanted to drop a detailed review for anyone curious. Overall, I‚Äôm very impressed . Here‚Äôs my honest take on each item:

    ‚Ä¢    Supreme Faux Fur Jacket:
This piece is insane. The faux fur is super soft, plush, and doesn‚Äôt look shiny or cheap at all. Lining is smooth and premium, the zip is solid, and the overall construction feels heavy and warm. Easily one of the best reps I‚Äôve touched ‚Äî 10/10.

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=902338470170

    
‚Ä¢    Supreme 23  Jersey :
Mesh quality is top tier ‚Äî thick and breathable without feeling stiff. Colors and prints are on point. Oversized fit looks great layered. A standout item if you‚Äôre into the vintage sports look.

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=899166957044

    ‚Ä¢    St√ºssy  Jerseys 
Both jerseys are very well made. The mesh isn‚Äôt too see-through, but I‚Äôd still recommend wearing a tee underneath unless you‚Äôre confident rocking it solo. Logos and tags are clean. Fit is TTS.

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=904181115505


    ‚Ä¢    Palace White Tee:
Simple but super clean. The triangle logo is placed perfectly, and the cotton feels soft and slightly stretchy. Perfect everyday tee with a minimal flex.

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ft=t&id=899172261492


    ‚Ä¢    Aim√© Leon Dore x New Balance short ):
One of the most comfortable items of the haul. The mesh is airy and breathable, waistband holds nicely, and the embroidery is very well done. Summer staple for sure.

Hi all, I know this a very NPC haul but I needed everyday pieces. I ordered the New Balance, crocs and jordans from Anonymous after seeing a few others on here had done the same. I ordered directly from them through whatsapp and paid via paypal. Total price was $127.7 or ¬£102 including paypal fees. About half of the cost was on shipping but they did say if I went through an agent it would probably be cheaper but I just preferred to go the straightforward route and buy direct. Very fast communication. Will update when they arrive.

new balance,Fragment Design x Sacai x Nike LDWaffle three-party collaboration,"\--Detailed design

The side is still matched with a white superimposed Swoosh, and the design of double shoelaces and double tongues creates a full sense of layering. The side of the midsole is marked with the item number coding element designed by Fujiwara Hiroshi. A thickened design is made under the original breathable mesh. The shoe body is made of suede material, which is tighter and thicker than before.

\--Hand-on experience

Although gray is the main color of New Balance, this pair of three-party joint gray is really good-looking. The real thing is a hundred times better than the picture. As always, the high street style, the materials are also full of sincerity, and the obvious height-increasing effect. Compared with the first navy blue color, this gray and white dress is more elegant and versatile.

\--Shoe size recommendation

The size is a bit small, it is recommended to choose a larger size, the shoe has a good wrapping property.",15,4,2025-05-04 11:38:55,FashionReps

new balance,8.6 kg JoyaGoo Haul to Canada,"Hey everyone, I'm doing another review of my latest haul.

Shipped out this haul with joyagoo about a week before tariffs were announced. I had no problems with joyagoo, I requested the agent pack all of the items inside the rimowa and use the box it came with, and they did just that with some added protection. This haul to Canada took about 30 days to arrive, which is much longer then usual, as my other hauls normally arrived within 2 weeks. However, the agent was undergoing a brand transition from joyabuy to joyagoo along with the announcement of the tariffs, so I can't really complain as everything arrived packed well and safely.

Getting to the review:

1. Rimowa suitcase: I spent some time researching one that was good quality and not ridiculously priced and I came across this one. This one came out to be 800CNY or about $177 CAD which is on par with regular suitcase prices and I'm really happy with the quality. The suitcase is very sturdy and strong as it should be, and the materials feel great. I opted to get the model with the locks and they are very good quality. you can personalize the code and change it whenever you like. The one downside is that it didn't come with a key in case you forget the combination, so make sure to write it down. It came with the proper packing inserts as well as a leather bag tag. I'm very happy I was able to get this. W2C:[¬†https://detail.1688.com/offer/810389645571.html](https://detail.1688.com/offer/810389645571.html)
2. Stussy Big ol Jorts: These jorts are some of the best I have ever seen. The quality is amazing, the denim feels authentic. The details are all there, even down to the small Stussy S on the pocket. The Stussy back tab is great quality. It's thick with a suede like texture and the Stussy logo is deeply embossed. I have zero complaints with these jorts. They were 200 CNY. I got size 32 and they fit perfectly on me, so I would definitely say TTS. W2C:[https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=fxg\_1325870.all\_page.0.0.37ff4e69nIO7C9&id=899333555276](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=fxg_1325870.all_page.0.0.37ff4e69nIO7C9&id=899333555276)
3. Jersey: I've had my eye on this jersey for a while and finally decided to cop it. I'm really happy with the jersey the quality is really good. The patches are stitched onto the jersey and the rest is screen printed on. The material is good and the thickness is on par with actual football jerseys. Its light which makes it great for summer. The only thing is its not overly baggy, so I would recommend to size up if you like more room in your jerseys. The jersey was 119 CNY. W2C:[https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg\_1325870.all\_page.0.0.49604e69hV7JwU&itemID=7310921825](https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg_1325870.all_page.0.0.49604e69hV7JwU&itemID=7310921825)
4. Stussy Shanghai hoodie: I was a bit disappointed with this one. I have a few authentic ones to compare with, and the quality on this hoodie isn't the best. First off, the Stussy logo on the front and back is a shiny screen print, and it should not be shiny at all. Second, the hoodie is not very thick and does not have a fuzzy inner lining like the authentic ones. It is also a bit small I got an XL and it fits like a L so definitely size up one. The hoodie was 159 CNY, which isn't terrible. W2C:[https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg\_1325870.all\_page.0.0.7bb04e69mDFjrS&itemID=7304527819](https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg_1325870.all_page.0.0.7bb04e69mDFjrS&itemID=7304527819)
5. New Balance 9060: I love these shoes, the quality on them is amazing. They are very soft and comfortable to wear, you could definitely spend an entire day walking in them. The suede feels great, and the stitching is nearly flawless. I got a size 45 and they fit perfectly so definitely go TTS. They were 180CNY. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† W2C:[https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7240545983&vc\_cps\_track=1459920903\_0\_0&vc\_cps\_track=1459920903\_0\_0](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemId=7240545983&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0&vc_cps_track=1459920903_0_0)
6. Stussy button up: I was just looking for a cheap button-up for summer and happened to come across this one. The quality is decent, the logo on the pocket is stitched on and doesn't have any flaws. The material is ok, it's not too thin, it's a good thickness for an overshirt. However, if you hold it up you can see through it a bit, but that's not the biggest deal if you're using it as an overshirt. It was 95 CNY.

7. Miu Miu wallet: I'm really impressed with the quality of the leather and the wallet. The stitching is flawless all throughout and the details on the golden clasp are perfect. Has 4 card slots inside and comes with all the proper packaging. great pickup for the price: 145CNY. W2C:[https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg\_1325870.all\_page.0.0.6e234e69nGzdBZ&itemID=7394795807](https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg_1325870.all_page.0.0.6e234e69nGzdBZ&itemID=7394795807)
8. YSL cardholder: Honestly, just came across this when looking for the Miu Miu wallet, its from the same seller and was part of an inventory clearout, so I got it very cheap. I wasn't expecting much since it was so cheap, but the quality is better than I thought. The materials are pretty good and the YSL logo is great. The problem with this one is more the craftsmanship. The front slot is a bit crooked and there is a few flaws in the stitching across the bottom, but again that's why it was so cheap. 29 CNY W2C:[https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg\_1325870.all\_page.0.0.1f6f4e69ETmBmo&itemID=7407483129](https://weidian.com/item.html?spm=fxg_1325870.all_page.0.0.1f6f4e69ETmBmo&itemID=7407483129)
9. CH keychain: Just wanted a cheap keychain and came across this. It has a good amount of weight to it and the details on the dice and dagger are pretty good. There is a couple blemishes and scratches but that was kind of expected for a cheap keychain. This seller does have quite a few different styles as well Price: 57 CNY.

New Balance 1000

I'd been wanting a New Balance 1000 for a while but couldn't decide on a colour. In the end I took this one, even if I realise that I should have taken another, I'm very happy with it. Never disappointed by the brand, always so comfortable.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454177591

Off white be right back 

To be honest, I'm a bit surprised, despite the fact that it's probably a batch that everyone has. The shape and comfort are very good. I recommend them!

Nike TL x Comme des Gar√ßons 

I already had the full white colourway and loved the pair. Unfortunately, me and white make two haha.So I took it back in this colour. I'm still just as happy with them, despite a few flaws. It's ok because that's not a very, very good batch.

Low grammage, so unfortunately it fits rather close to the body. It's not bad at all, because the t-shirt is pretty good.

Supreme Boxers

I'd already bought some in a haul, they're really good.

AirPods Pro 2

As a comparison, I have the AirPods Max in retail, and for sure the sound quality and noise reduction is obviously not as good. However, it's still pretty good. I've used them 2/3 times when I'm too lazy to take my headphones, and it's really not bad.

new balance,9.5KG haul to Canada,"First time making a review since like '16. Used to be big in the rep game back when yeezy 350 turtle dove was first released. When the community was debating about the turtledove 8 eye placements, the slants and angles of the patterns, the shape of the boost on the bottom. David or ZZTOP had the best batch?? 

Anyways, I am sad to see the community going from nitpicking the minute details to labelling anything to 10/10. I have spent thousands on reps and threw away/donated most of them cause of cheap material and poor constructions. My review for this haul will be upheld to my standard with authentic clothing, looking at material, shape, construction, quality, and fit. I will only give 10/10 to deserving pieces. That being said, here we go.

I used Mulebuy, 9.5 kg, $93USD/$128CAD, used China post-MG-JM line, took 17days exactly to Canada. Declared less than 20$CAD for the entire haul. No problems with customs, no tariffs, no taxes.   

The items I chose are mostly from reputable sellers found across the different rep subreddits. I GP'ed a few items without too much reviews. I will be posting mulebuy links as I am trying to get their reward system thing so we will see how this works. Just being transparent. 

Shipping/agent review:

Mulebuy was easy to work with, usually takes 1-2 business days to place orders. QC pics are ok. Parcel was packed well, individually wrapped as seen in the pics. Shipping is a bit expensive but it's been working for me so I am sticking with it. The only downside is the time exchanging communication with the agent, sometimes it takes a whole business day to get a response but it's fine, time difference I guess. Overall experience: 8/10. If the shipping cost is lower and faster communication, I'd give the experience 9/10. 

  
Item reviews:

Personal stat: 6'2, 190lbs, ok muscular build. Usually wear size 10 US for shoes & between M/L for tops. 33 waist for Jeans.

1. New Balance 530 - Milk Tea colorway. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7237472694](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7237472694)

Got these for my wife, the pictures shown on seller page looks more beige, the QC photos from Mulebuy looks beige as well, but item in hand show some slight pink hues. Wife was unhappy about the colors at first as she is often picky but ended up liking them after wearing them as her primary shoes for a trip. No one will legit check you for NB, I was most worried about comfort and she said it felt great and didn't hurt at all during the trip. We walked an average of 15k steps per day for 6 days straight, shoe held up well, no pain or discomfort which is a plus. 8/10 (2 points off for color difference and wife's initial dissatisfaction) 

  
2.  Converse Chuck 70s - White. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=4405090738](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=4405090738)

Got these again for wife. Sized down half size due to recommendations from other redditors. Fits well. I had these in black in men from previous haul and it's held up well. Wife says the toebox plastic feels fake but she has no idea what she's talking about. Feels fine and looks fine to me. Once again no one LC converse chucks so I worry most about comfort. My experience with my own pair has been good. The laces lost its shape a little after a few months but no other problems. 9/10 

  
3.  NB 1906 - White/Green. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7242844795](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7242844795)

Got these in 43=43.5, comes as US men 9.5, was hoping for US men 10, should've sized up. It fits me but fits me SNUG. I have overpronation so hopefully it won't wreck the shoes too fast. quality feels ok, accuracy is good but saw a retail pair the other day and the retail has a more pronounced shape and box. Just came back from grocery shopping in them to test these, walked around 2k steps, felt fine. Only complaint is narrow toebox and feels like im walking very close to the ground. I never had the narrow toebox problem so these might fit narrow/tight. Overall regretted not sizing up, hopefully they hold up and not cause too much feet pain. 6/10 

  
4. Doc Martens - Black. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=4296908270](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=4296908270)

Got these in 43, comes as US men 10. TTS, fits well. Construction looks good, tight stitching, one loose thread at the tongue. Feels durable. Biggest complaint is the leather/plastic. I felt a pair of retail (not sure if it was the made in england or thailand version) and the leather/plastic on the retail felt much thicker and durable. These are already kinda creasing after trying them on and bending the toe box a little bit. But for the price, not bad. 6/10 

  
5. Nike socks - Black & White. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7277013760](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7277013760)

Fit well but material is very thick. Felt almost unnatural. Some lint balls as you take them off, but they're just Nike socks. Which the cotten was thinner but more compact. When you walk in them it feels like the material glides slightly between the contact surface, gave me some footpain with my overpronation. Could be my shoes though. 7/10 

  
6. Blank Artiemaster Tank. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=ali\_1688&id=863494916888](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=ali_1688&id=863494916888)

Got these in size L, thin cotton material, hate the side openings. It felt like someone just ran it through with a scissor. Fits a bit too wide and unnatural. Will try to shrink them on purpose in dryer to see if the fit improves. Maybe I just got the wrong size. Tank in wash as I type this. 5/10 

7. Black Carhartt Stallion T - Black. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=857493680213](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=857493680213)

Got these in size L from Saul goodman (look him up on yupoo). Had a big selection. The fit is pretty good, material slightly thin, after receiving I realized this may be a fantasy piece. Seen some authentic in white but none in black. At the end of the day, who cares? Just Carhartt. Wish material good be thicker and boxier. 7/10

  
8. RL Polo - XL Navy Blue. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=weidian&id=7221752639](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7221752639)

Got these from RepKingdom, seen raving reviews for this seller. Was not disappointed. Material feels nice, fits well. compared to retail I think it's slightly thinner, but the difference is not noticeable. 9.5/10 

  
9. A\*LD shorts - Green Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=809568916897](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=809568916897)

Got these from TSARCHIVE, heard he is one of the better A\*LD sellers. The color is way greener than I thought, thought it would be a more darker green color instead of shiny forest green. Will need to change my ideas of outfits with this one. The materials actually feel REALLY nice, the waist band is thick, the cloth is heavy, doesn't feel like your regular mesh gym shorts. Feels premium, just a bit upset about the color. Not sure how the retail pairs look but I will rock them regardless. 8/10 

  
10. Carhartt Detroit Jacket J97 - Size XL, Moss Green. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=ali\_1688&id=709715593267](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=ali_1688&id=709715593267)

Saw some others review this jacket, got them in XL because I saw one user mentioning that it fits short. I shouldn't have listened because I ordered 1 size larger than the measurement that fitted me and it was too big. If I had just gone with the measurement it would fit better. Maybe QC issues with consistency? IDK. The material is thick and heavy, some lint balls already coming out though. The collar is just dyed with brown, can clearly see how it's kinda sprayed on as it's not done cleanly. Going to wash it and shrink it to see if it fits better. Overall a bit disappointed in this piece due to sizing, lint balls, and the dyed collar. I am unsure if there is a better batch out there tbh, I have looked everywhere on subreddits and this was the best batch with cheapest price. I might be wrong, please comment if you know alternatives. I might look on ebay for a vintage retail. 5/10 

  
11. IDLT shorts - Grey Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=723527917267](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=723527917267)

Wanted to get a pair of IDLT blank shorts and a Artiemaster to compare. 100% cotton, feels like it. Solid build, good stitching, good material. More expensive than Artiemaster, and I personally prefer the Artiemaster more. If you like light weight shorts, you might prefer this one. 7/10 



12. Artiemaster shorts - Washed black Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=ali\_1688&id=885330906540](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=ali_1688&id=885330906540)

Love love LOVE this pair of shorts for the price. 430 GSM, 100% cotton. Really feels solid in hands. Fits well, heavy weight. Feels premium for sure. If I buy something like this at the mall I am probably looking at 60-80$ cad due to quality. These only cost 10ish $cad. Best bang for my buck for sure. Already have a few more Artiemaster sweats in my cart that I am going to try. Will always go for 100% cotton. 9.5/10

  
13. CDG homme shirt - White, Size L. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=692707728424](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=692707728424)

Got these from RepBrothers. Really like the design and saw he carried them. Known reputable seller for PA. The fit is ok, definitely too long for my liking. The material is thin but holds the shape, my nipples aren't showing through them. The neckline is a bit loose but we will see how it holds up. Wish it was shorter and more cropped but it may be just how the shirt is built. The print looks fine. Will be layering with these and tucking them in. 7/10

  
14. A\*LD T Shirt - White, Size M. [https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop\_type=taobao&id=730699752212](https://mulebuy.com/product/?shop_type=taobao&id=730699752212)

Got these from TSARCHIVE like the green gym shorts. Slightly disappointed in these after seeing how well the gym shorts were constructed. The materials feel thin, length slightly too long, sleeves a tad short, and the shape is flimsy, can see my nips through them as they are tight around the chest but the shoulder lines sits right. IDK, putting them in the wash now hopefully it shrinks in length and not around the chest (lol). Maybe this is just how the authentic fits and feel? Never felt or try the retail so I can't compare. Slightly disappointed but will try to make this work into my layering and tucked. 5/10

  
15. A\*LD Socks 

From TSARCHIVE as well. Looks fine. Just socks, havent tried them on yet. Embroidery looks fine. 

  
That's it! Thanks for reading and hopefully this helps other redditors with your decision making like how these subs have helped me. ",56,25,2025-04-23 16:14:38,FashionReps

1. **Is Malay EMS just a rebranded or new version of EMS-HN?**
2. **Why does Malay EMS not include the same ""care service"" that EMS-HN used to offer?**
3. **Why are those care services still being offered if I choose UPS or USPS, but not for Malay EMS? Is it risky ?**
4. **Anyone know what happened to EMS-HN and why it‚Äôs no longer available, especially for shipping to the U.S.?**

I‚Äôm currently shipping to the U.S. and used to rely on EMS-HN for the balance of speed, and safety. If anyone has experience with the new Malay EMS (delivery times, safety, risk of seizure), I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback.",5,21,2025-04-21 06:58:09,FashionReps

This is my first huge haul since pandabuy raids and I'm happy it arrived!

My stats: Height - 177cm, Weight - 82.5kg

All links are posted in comments!

As some of you may know Peng is a new derschutze seller, so I decided to GP some tees for the sake of fashionreps.

Derschutze Awakening V2 tee size L from peng (CN¬•95/CA$18):
- Tee feels high quality, and uses some decently thick cotton. This is the best feeling rep tee I've gotten. Embroidery looks nice and there are not any loose threads. The entire back of the tee being embroidered does make it feel stiffer, and of course you can feel it on your back when you wear it. Fits true to size. Shirt fits cropped, sizing chart does indicate the length so if you dislike shorter length shirts make sure to check.

Derschutze Jazz V2 tee size L from peng (CN¬•85/CA$16):
- This tee is also good quality fabric and feels nice. The embroidery looks good to me and again has no quality defects. Fits true to size.

Derschutze Koi fish jeans size 34 from firereps (CN¬•300/CA$58):
- Jeans fit TTS and have a baggy fit. The material used feels good and quality, comparable to any jeans I can buy in stores. The wash on the jeans is not super blended which you can see in the yupoo pics, so be wary of that if you dislike it. Embroidery looks good however my pair had some threads poking out on the front pocket embroidery.

Eric Emanuel pink daisy shorts size L (CN¬•155/CA$30):
- Shorts fit TTS and inseam seems to be ~5"". Quality feels good and the holes in the fabric don't make them see through. Feel like your average jersey shorts and should be good in summer. Ordered a more expensive batch to get this colourway, but it feels the same as the 99 RMB batch.

Eric Emanuel shorts size L (CN¬•99/CA$19):
- Fits TTS and the fabric feels good. Fits like other jersey shorts and should be good for summer.

Miu Miu hoodie size L from premium888(CN¬•455/CA$88):
- This hoodie is super high quality. The material is super thick and comfortable and all of the stitching is great, I'd be happy to get this from a store here in Canada. Fits TTS with a boxy fit and is cropped (L is 66cm length), so if you plan to buy look at the size chart for sure.

Miu Miu jacket size L from premium888 (CN¬•425/CA$82):
- Jacket fits TTS with a baggier fit, most notable in the sleeves. Quality is good but it must be noted that this jacket is thin and NOT suitable for cold weather, more of a spring/summer accessory jacket.

Miu Miu sweatshirt size L (CN¬•388/CA$75):
- Sweatshirts are good quality and fit TTS with a cropped fit. Material is on the thinner side and feels a bit rough rather than being super soft, but fits great and is good for spring.

Miu Miu new balance 530 size 44 (CN¬•558/CA$108):
- These fit TTS and are good quality, however are a bit more narrow than other shoes so maybe stay away if you have wide feet. The sole design creates a suction on the heel. I had to cut some rubber out so I didn't sound like spongebob walking around the grocery store.

Stussy jeans size 34 from 3Madman (CN¬•220/CA$42):
- Fit TTS with a baggy fit and have a super nice light blue colour. Fly is button up rather than a zipper which threw me off when I noticed. Material feels nice and high quality.

Dime jeans size L from 3Madman (CN¬•190/CA$37):
- Fit TTS with a baggy fit, make sure to use the size chart to find your sizing. The material feels good and the back pockets are neat with the squiggly design.

Arte flower cardigan size L from 3Madman (CN¬•330/CA$64):
- Fits TTS however longer than other sweatshirts I have. Material is super nice, and the fabric is decently dense so the cardigan drapes nicely if worn unzipped. The dark green is an amazing colour and this is now a staple in my wardrobe and I think has made me the best dressed engineer at work, dont regret getting this at all.

Rhude tee size XL (CN¬•108/CA$21):
- Fits TTS. Feels good quality and the graphic on the back seems to be high quality but time will tell if it cracks quickly. The colours on this are nice, and it's a good summer tee to wear at races.

Ralph Lauren black cable knit size XL (CN¬•105/CA$20):
- Fits about a size small, so if you normally wear size L I'd get XL like I did. Fits the tightest around the forearms and shoulders, but if you don't workout it should be fine. Material feels nice and is comfortable to wear, and the logo looks good.

Ralph Lauren brown cable knit quarter zip size XL (CN¬•148/CA$29):
- This also fits about a size small, being smallest around shoulders/forearms. Material feels good and is comfortable. The zipper/collar was the main concern for me with quarter zips as I've gotten ones that have horrible zippers or collars that can't be folded down, however this sweatshirt doesn't have that issue.

Ralph Lauren quarter zips size XL (CN¬•150/CA$29):
- Again these fit about a size smaller. The material is comfortable and is not super thick but not too thin, perfect for around the office or in spring weather. Logo on all the RL looks fine to me, however I also do not care too much about the logo accuracy.

Arc‚Äôteryx year of the snake jacket size L from premium888 (CN¬•546/CA$105):
- Got this from premium888 due to him being the only person with it in stock when I purchased it. Fits TTS, and all of the stitching details are good quality. The jacket zippers all work perfectly and all of the adjustment straps do too. The material does bead water and has kept me dry in heavy rain so far, and works great as a rain jacket/windbreaker.

Margiela knit sweaters size XL (CN¬•198/CA$38):
- Both of these sweatshirts are nice and thick and hold up well from wear so far. The material is comfortable and on mine there are no loose threads or anything in the knit. They fit TTS.

Kith New balance 1906 size 44 (CN¬•260/CA$50):
- Fit TTS. These are good shoes, comfortable to wear and look good, not much else to say.

Birkenstock clogs size 44 (CN¬•210/CA$41):
- Fit 0.5-1 size too large, size 44 fits more like a size 45 on me. Other than them running large they are comfortable, and the adjustable buckle on the side works, is actually metal, and durable.

Blank hoodie size XL from Union Kingdom(CN¬•299/CA$58):
- Fits TTS with a cropped fit, and is super dense cotton. For me personally the thick cotton makes the hoodie thicker than I prefer for wear, especially as the hood is pointy and holds its form due to the thick material. The hoodie is a good material so if you like dense cotton it's a good pickup.

Patagonia Toques (beanies) (CN¬•35/CA$7):
- Fit my big ass head so I'll call them TTS. Bonus that they don't have a crazy amount of material making them super long, more fitted to the head. They feel good, but I have yet to get the chance to test their capabilities in cold weather.

Nike socks (CN¬•24/CA$5):
- These socks are actually great. They are nice and thick like actual nike socks and are comfortable to wear. They are more expensive than other nike socks you can get but I think its worth it for them to actually be good quality socks.

new balance,ASICS Kayano 14 X JJJJound Silver Black - ZC - YOLO - ¬•240 in hand.,"
I just received these Kayano 14s in hand from Yolo and am very pleasantly surprised.
These are the ZC batch which generally with ASICS and New Balance are the best batch out there being very close to retail versions.

These early 2000s mesh runners are one of the most popular shoes on the market at the moment making a revival as people are preferring to wear a comfortable shoe rather than one that looks good but is very uncomfortable for walking around all day.

I went true to size and they fit perfectly. Normally I go up half a size in Nile‚Äôs and Jordan‚Äôs as I have a slightly wider foot. Looking at retail pictures I‚Äôd have to say they nailed this shoe. They look very accurate from the gel material to the mesh and cuts.

I gotta say walking around all day in these they are super comfortable. I would highly recommend these to anyone. I‚Äôm sure if you get a pair it will quickly become the shoe you leave next to from door and chuck on when you go out. Also at ¬•240 they are very affordable.

Here's a haul I've just received, with all the W2Cs as usual.

Down Jacket - 886 ÁªøËâ≤ - 378CNY - Size M (TTS)

Finally, I'm not sure it's a down jacket as it's relatively thin. On the other hand, it's very high quality and has a good fit.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434157966

Palace jumper - 348CNY - Size L (Size Up)

I already had it in M, I really liked it but it was very tight in the sleeves and waist, so not very comfortable. I took it back in the right size and I'm still happy with it. Super-soft fabric inside, quite thick, good finish (except for 2/3 threads sticking out on the logo, but quick to remove)... nothing to say.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434059838

Ami Zip - 466CNY - Size L (size up)

I hesitated a lot before buying it, because I was afraid of how it would fit. In the end it's amazing, I'm very happy with the purchase but the zip is very tough. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any ideas to overcome this problem.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432272271

Stone Island Short - 10 - 228CNY

It's great quality, I have nothing to say about that. I advise you to size up. However, the only issue is the patches, so I would still recommend getting some from TopStoney and putting them on.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432303807

Vest - 1 - 458CNY - Size M (TTS)

I had already ordered the same one in green and loved both the quality and the fit. So I ordered it again in another colour and I'm very happy!

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434154018

Stussy Shorts - 1 - 148CNY - Size M (TTS)

The shorts are specially heavy and have a good. They look a bit like basketball shorts.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434077286

Human Made X Kaws T-shirt - 3934ÈªëËâ≤ - 158CNY - Size M (TTS)

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, but in the end I was pleasantly surprised. The fit and quality are great and so are the designs. I especially recommend it for the price!

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434148054

Arte T-shirt - 158CNY - Size M (TTS)

I had an Arte t-shirt a long time ago from DragonRep and the sizing wasn't crazy at all. This one is much better, the fit and the quality is better too. I'm thinking of getting some more.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7421958977&spider_token=9cec

Supreme Jersey - 128CNY - Size M (TTS)

I'd already bought it in a last haul, and I took it back for a mate who loved it.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7409934908&spider_token=71b5

T-shirt Ami - 91CNY - Size L (Size Up)

The T-shirt are of pretty good quality, the fit is good and the logo are very good too.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432217791&spider_token=33ab

Palace x Vivienne Westwood T-shirt - 139ÁôΩ - 133CNY - Size M (TTS)

There's nothing to say about the quality.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434048432&spider_token=9009

Yeezy 350 - 309CNY - Size 46 (Size Up)

I have had a retail for almost 1 year and aesthetically as well as comfort I have nothing to say, very shocked at the reproduction of the boost. Unfortunately they're slightly smaller even though I used the same size, so I hope they open up as I go along.

I hope this haul has inspired you to buy. Don't hesitate to ask me any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

new balance,"8,5KG Haul to Germany + 4 pair of shoes per direct shipping","Hi Guys Shiba is back with another Review. I shipped the clothes with an Agent and Trendyclub have sent me the 4 pairs of shoes directly to my home. So lets start:

1. Acne Studios Longsleeve from TopAcney
The print looks and feels pretty high quality. The fit is very oversized so I chose XS as my size. The longsleeve is quite thin but I think it will be the same for retail.   

2. Acne Studios Faded Shirt from MartinReps
The shirt is ok. I would not order it again. The fit is good but it doesn't really feel high quality.

3. Acne studios scarf frm TopAcney
The scarf is EXTREMELY big and thin, I had completely wrong expectations of this one but I like it quite well, it doesn't scratch at all.

4. Carhartt carpenter pants
I'm happy with the pants, they have the Carhartt branding on the back. The pants are not oversized, but I took them one size larger so that they are a bit baggy. 

5. Acne Studios Keychain Denim 1981M from i795
Unfortunately, the size chart doesn't fit a bit, so the pants are a bit too small for me, but that shouldn't really happen at such a price. The quality of the denim is also only ok, nothing that really stands out. 

6. Stussy Big Ol Denim from 3madman
The pants are my favorite of the haul, I ordered them one size too big so they are even more baggy than they already are. I can recommend these pants 100%.

7. ERD Wallet Chain
Quality is mid. Spend your money somewhere else.

8. Timberland Boots from Trendyclub
I dont know how accurate they are but i love them. After some walks they are finally comfy af. Plus Point they are watter resistant. They are TTS

9. Balenciaga Runner VG Batch from Trendyclub
They are a bit Painful for the first few walks but as soon as you breaking them are also very comfy. 
I sized down one time.

10. New Balance 9060 from Trendyclub
I bought them for my girlfriend in two colorways and shes in love with them. I sized up 1,5 sizes and its perfect.
Shes walking in them everytime since they are here.

Artie master blank tees - XXL & XXL
https://detail.1688.com/offer/693373886409.html
I got 8 of them and they‚Äôre great quality for the price, and a nice shape, not too long.The only downside is they‚Äôre a bit see through and the collar is small. 

Union Kingdom 500gsm blank sweats - L
https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=846963084065
These are the denim blue colour and are a bit lighter in person compared to his yupoo, but darker than QC. These pants are amazing and they are heavyweight and warm. They‚Äôre genuinely highest quality sweats i‚Äôve had and I can‚Äôt recommend them more. They‚Äôre a perfect fit and not too short either. 

Random black wide leg sweats - XXL
https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=864918744962
I don‚Äôt recommend these if you want the same fit as they show on the listing, but they fit good as a normal baggy pant. They‚Äôre not as thick or high quality as Union‚Äôs and have a silk like lining. Other than those the wash is nice and same with the other details but a bit misleading. Definitely size up according to the size guide.

XL batch grey campus 00s - 38
https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7248271058
These are really high quality and super comfortable, they‚Äôre thick and have lots of padding like retail. The only thing that stood out was the logos on the back are a bit wonky but that could be unlucky. Also come with grey laces. 

DT Batch new balance 530 - 38
https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7228678159
These too are pretty great quality and I don‚Äôt see much wrong with them. They are comfortable too. 

PE Batch air max 95 Jewel - 44
https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7242507540
Other than GX batch there‚Äôs no top tier batch especially for these. They‚Äôre good but not great. They have a decent feel to them but feel a bit lighter and cheap. The materials don‚Äôt feel amazing and definitely worse than the previous. I also think the colour is slightly off but other than that the shoe looks overall fine and feels fine.

new balance,haul to canada 4kg just to learn how to buy,"hi guys, i'm very new in this replicas area. i live in oshawa, canada. i saw a lot of people here teaching how to buy and i saw in some posts about this store and i took advantage of that i was as i had a lot of doubts i still didn't have the confidence to use several stores. i bought a few pieces just to do a test, i was recommended all china buy and i bought everything there. i hope you can help me with defects that i don't know how to see, and i'll tell you here what i thought of the pieces:

1. Black Leather Hoodie ‚Äì 9/10

This hoodie brings a sleek and modern edge with its faux leather finish, making it a standout layering piece. The slightly oversized fit ensures comfort while maintaining a structured look. The gold zipper adds a subtle touch of luxury, elevating the overall aesthetic. Perfect for colder weather or adding a bold statement to any outfit.

2. Black Graphic Tee ‚Äì 8.5/10

A stylish yet minimal piece featuring an intricate clockwork-style design, adding a subtle gothic feel. The fabric appears soft with a nice drape, ideal for everyday wear. The black color enhances versatility, making it easy to pair with jeans or joggers. A great option for those who appreciate understated but detailed graphics.

3. White Graphic Tee ‚Äì 8.5/10

Identical in design to the black tee but offering a lighter contrast, this piece provides more variety in styling. The white color makes the intricate print stand out more, adding a fresh and clean touch. The fit appears relaxed and comfortable, great for layering or wearing solo. A solid essential for a modern streetwear rotation.

4. Black Oversized Sweatshirt ‚Äì 9/10

This sweatshirt delivers a classic oversized streetwear silhouette with a cozy, heavy fabric. The minimal branding makes it versatile while maintaining a premium feel. Perfect for casual layering, whether over a t-shirt or under a heavier jacket. A must-have for those who prefer effortless, relaxed fits with a high-fashion touch.

5. Carhartt Black Pants ‚Äì 9.5/10

Durable and functional, these black Carhartt pants bring a workwear-inspired aesthetic to a more modern, city-friendly look. The material appears rugged yet comfortable, perfect for everyday wear. The clean-cut design allows easy pairing with sneakers, boots, or even the suede slip-ons. A staple piece for anyone into utilitarian fashion with a sleek edge.

6. Carhartt Blue Jeans ‚Äì 9/10

A classic denim piece that delivers durability and timeless style with its mid-wash blue tone. The relaxed fit ensures comfort while still maintaining structure, making it great for both casual and workwear-inspired looks. The signature Carhartt patch on the back pocket adds a nice branded touch. A great alternative to slim-cut jeans for those who appreciate a looser, laid-back fit.

7. Studded Black Belt ‚Äì 8.5/10

A statement accessory that adds a punk-inspired element to any outfit. The silver studs provide a rebellious touch, elevating even the simplest jeans-and-tee combo. The leather material appears sturdy, ensuring longevity and wearability. Perfect for those who like small details that make a big impact.

8. Brown Suede Slip-On Shoes ‚Äì 8.5/10

A unique footwear choice that blends comfort with effortless style, ideal for casual fits. The suede texture adds a soft, luxurious feel, making them look more refined than standard slip-ons. The adjustable buckle strap enhances both fit and design, creating a slightly vintage, laid-back aesthetic. Great for balancing streetwear and casual elegance.

Hello all, in this post I‚Äôm reviewing all the products that i ordered and received. Mind you, I just received this order so it is purely on first in-hand impressions and not how they hold up or anything like that because i haven‚Äôt had the chance to yet.

I ordered this haul using EastMallBuy as my agent. This was my 5th haul or so with them and i‚Äôve been sticking with them since the raids. They are very good and the shipping prices are very fair, I paid $180 for 13kg.

Here are all the item links and what i think of each item in-hand. If there is interest in more detailed pictures of certain items please lmk and I‚Äôll make a separate post!

new balance,"HAUL Review- RocketExpress - 8kg - DHL - 600$ - New Balance, Kaws, Human Made, Chrome Hearts, Gentle Monster, Maison Margiela, Stussy, Supreme, Arte, Louis Vuitton & CP Company","Hi, I hope you're all well! 

They don't have a website (yet), but you can order via Discord. Everything is explained on the Discord, which can be a bit strange at first but you soon get it.

--------------------------------------------

Details of the haul:

I paid for the items on the 13th, I received the last QCs on 26 February, and on 28 February I received the delivery price. Normally you get the price on the same day as the last QC, but in this case they took a bit longer.

The agent told me that it normally takes 15/18 days. I paid for delivery on 28 February and got my tracking number the same day.

I received the parcel on 13 March, so it took 13 days to arrive. In the end it was quicker than the agent said. 

--------------------------------------------

What about the price?

Delivery was $106.9 (including insurance) for 8kg in volume. The total cost of the items was $484.2, making a total of $591.1.

--------------------------------------------

Is this a good haul?

Stats: 1m83/90kg

--------------------------------------------

Down Jacket - Goat - 298CNY - Size M (TTS)

Finally, I'm not sure it's a down jacket as it's relatively thin. On the other hand, it's very high quality and has a good fit.

--------------------------------------------

Vest - Goat - 238CNY - Size M (TTS)

I had already ordered the same one in green and loved both the quality and the fit. So I ordered it again in another colour and I'm very happy!

--------------------------------------------

Chrome Hearts Glasses - Enzoo Optical - $55

Very cool, the weight are good and are well finished. Nothing to say!

--------------------------------------------

Maison Margiela X Gentle Monster Glasses - Enzoo Optical - $49

As for the Chrome Hearts, I have nothing special to say, but these are really beautiful and have a nice design.

--------------------------------------------

Stussy Shorts - 888rep - 200CNY - Size M (TTS)

The shorts are specially heavy and have a good fit. They look a bit like basketball shorts.

--------------------------------------------

Supreme T-shirt - 888rep - 160CNY - Size M (TTS)

Good fit, ok quality, nothing special to say.

--------------------------------------------

Kaws X Human Made T-shirt - 888rep - 130CNY - Size M (size down)

Unfortunately it's quite large in both length and width, but it's a cool shirt.

--------------------------------------------

New Balance 1906R - YOLO - M BATCH - 220CNY - Size 46 (TTS)

Super nice and very comfortable. I am very happy with this purchase!

--------------------------------------------

Arte T-shirt - FireRep - 120CNY - Size M (TTS)

I had an Arte t-shirt a long time ago from DragonRep and the sizing wasn't crazy at all. This one is much better, the fit and the quality is better too. I'm thinking of getting some more.

--------------------------------------------

Stone Island Cap - Topstoney - 85CNY - Size L (One Size)

Very cool! Comes down well over the ears and is adjustable. I'm thinking of getting the grey one.

--------------------------------------------

Louis Vuitton Cap - OGwave - 138CNY - One Size Only

SHIT!

--------------------------------------------

Supreme Boxer - Baymax - 35CNY - Size L (TTS)

Nothing to say about the product itself... but to say that it's a pack of 2 but that there's only one per pack isn't serious at all...

--------------------------------------------

Stussy Slipper - Baymax - 49CNY - Size 45-46 (size up)

Super cool but they're more a 44-45 than a 45-46. I'm going to keep them anyway so I can wear them around the house.

--------------------------------------------

Ice Knit CP Company - Malphite - 480CNY - Size L (TTS)

I already did a light review on it on my last haul: https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/s/qhlmHsKrlo

I just went back to the right size because XL was a bit too big. A bit long at the waist and sleeves. In L it's perfect, I did well because it's a really good article.

--------------------------------------------

I hope this haul has inspired you to buy. Don't hesitate to ask me any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.",331,67,2025-03-14 12:17:58,FashionReps

new balance,First Pair of Rep Shoes ‚Äì New Balance 2002R from Sharkbreeeder!,"Just picked up my first pair of rep shoes ‚Äì the New Balance 2002R from Sharkbreeeder, and I‚Äôm seriously impressed! The quality is way better than I expected. The materials feel premium, with a great mix of suede and mesh. The fit is true to size, and the cushioning is super comfy, making them perfect for everyday wear.

The colorway is clean with just the right amount of contrast to make them stand out without being too loud. Honestly, this is a solid first rep pick especially for 35 bucks.

Would love to hear what you think!

Honest and quick review and W2C below:

New Balance 9060: I have the originals and it is somewhat 95% the same in design. The fit is okay but walking in them isn‚Äôt the same as original. But for the price all good. 
W2C: https://cnfans.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7291427203&ref=2571533

Nike Dunk: Love everything about it. Would give it a 10/10. Comfortable and really similar to original as per retail photos. 
W2C: https://cnfans.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7291485991&ref=2571533

Ami Tshirt: The size and material is crazy for this price but I think I made a mistake because I don‚Äôt think this shirt design is available in retail (size of A‚ù§Ô∏è)
W2C: https://cnfans.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7351769997&ref=2571533

Amiri Tshirt: Also made a mistake because retail doesn‚Äôt make this design I guess because I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere. But material is great. 
W2C: https://cnfans.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7352779790&ref=2571533

Off-White glasses: Man these were surprising af, for 3$ these glasses are bomb. Only problem is no branding on the inside sides. 
W2C: https://cnfans.com/product/?shop_type=weidian&id=7242385988&ref=2571533

Palm angles Shorts and Pants: these are crazy good. The material is so soft and the color is neat. As for the stitching its 9/10.

Agent: HubbuyCN

Estimated Weight: 8.7kg

Actual Weight: 9.6kg

Haul Items: (4 shoes , shoelaces)

Shipping line: FJ-US Actual Weight

Shipping Time: 23 Days Total, Submitted 1/19 Delivered 2/11

(delayed due to Chinese New Year, Cali fire)

Shipping Price: ¬•1074 Freight , ¬•6 Moisture Proof Bag , ¬•4 Stretch Film , ¬•5 Corner Protector, ¬•6 Bubble Wrap , ¬•31.15 Insurance ,¬†**Total ¬•1126.15 ($155.25 USD) ( had to pay another $20-$30 for fees)**

This is my first haul with HubbuyCN and I can say it was a pretty good experience, the website is pretty easy to use just copy & paste link in search bar and buy, all my items got to the warehouse within 4 days, I highly recommend this agent and I will do another haul with them.

¬†I did run into some problems though, using the website on phone is only good to get an freight estimation, for some reason I couldn't do that on computer but Id recommend using computer when ordering and accessing the site anyways, When I submitted my parcel I paid with PayPal what the total was and the next day I had to pay the remainder, and I had to pay a lot fees to even pay the rest cause I was forced to use my balance option($20-30) I don't know if that was a bug or what, I couldn't use a coupon I tried using all the ones I had from sign up link and not a single one worked kind of bummed I could have saved some extra cash. But I was at fault cause I could have talked to customer support and found a solution but I tried to get out right before CNY, this is my second time using an agent and I've noticed the price with this agent is way cheaper then the one I used previously, I do feel as direct would have been cheaper for me since my shoe size is a 13 and the shoes are a bit heavy and I would've gotten everything faster and for a bit cheaper.

new balance,"4.98 KG Budget Kakobuy Haul To USA [Sp5der, Denim Tears, New Balance, UGG, St√ºssy, Broken Planets, Dior]","I recently tried Kakobuy for the first time, having heard great things since it rebranded from Hagobuy. It was a light, budget-friendly haul, and I was really impressed with how Kakobuy had the cheapest prices for the same items compared to other agents (was anywhere from a couple of cents to a couple of dollars - but it adds up). The website is the exact same as Hagobuy was - easy to navigate. I picked up a few trendy clothes and some other essential items. I haven't received the items in hand yet, but I‚Äôm already looking forward to making another purchase. All items were purchased by Kakobuy within 1-7 hours.

new balance,"9,5KG Haul to Germany + 3 Shoes per direct shipping","Hi Shiba is back with another haul review.
This time I picked different brands like Lacoste, ERD but also Balenciaga and Vetements.
I shipped 9.5kg with AllChinaBuy and ordered 3 pairs of shoes per direct shipping.
So here we go.
w2c in the comments

ERD shirt by TopHot | 30$.
Like other ERD reps, the fabric is very comfortable. It fits me perfectly, not too oversized and not too cropped.

Lacoste knit sweater by French Fish | 38$
I was surprised by the quality of the fabric, I was expecting standard Cloud Shop quality.
But it feels like real wool and high quality. Now I know why everyone is hyping it up.

MiuMiu jumper by SatanMade | 28$
As expected, the sweater is very comfortable. I should have gone for TTS but I can still wear it with no problem.
The stitching could be a bit more as it feels a bit loose but it will do the job.

ERD pants by TopHot | 55$.
I was so happy with these pants that my brother wanted them so I ordered him a pair.
As ive said in my last review im very happy with the denim quality and overall fit of the pants.

Lacoste Shorts by French Fish | 25$
Just like the knit sweater, I am very happy with the shorts.
These are the first shorts I have owned that are really stretchy and the fabric quality is very good.
 
Balenciaga Striker Boots by Anonymous | 82$
Theres no good batch for the strikers yet, but they have been my Holy Grail for several months now so I had to order them as I couldnt wait any longer.
Im very happy with them, the ""distressing"" isnt as retail but I really dont care about that. 

Vetements Gun Club Hoodie by KJmade | 55$
I recently bought the MBT hoodie from KJmade and im still very happy with it, the same is with the Gun Club. Its comfortable and have a good fabric quality.
I chose size XS so its not that oversized and I couldnt choose better.

Vetements police hoodie from Redwave | 80$.
WOW. At first I was a bit sceptical as everyone was hyping Redwave to be the best seller for Vetements. And oh boy, you guys were right.
This is the most comfortable Vetements hoodie I own and I am so happy with it.
The hoodie is out of stock but you can ask Redwave for a remainder, which is how I ordered mine.

Nike x TS Jordan 4 from Wannabuy | 77$ | GX Batch
Overall I would recommend GX for this shoe. I think it is worth the price and If you want decent quality go with GX.
I was a bit worried at first because the shoes were really squeaky but after 2-3 walks they are silent as a grave.
They are really comfortable and im very happy with them.

Nocta Hot Step 2 from Wannabuy | 42$
For the Price im really happy with this pair of Shoe. As the Jordans they were a bit uncomfortable at first but after a few walks they are really comfy now.

New Balance 9060 from Wannabuy | 45$
My gf is in LOVE with this pair of shoe. Shes wearing them everyday for over a week now.
I also tried them and they are mad comfy. I can totally recommend them.",405,99,2025-02-05 10:37:56,FashionReps

I have seen photos of people with retail and at some angles they look to be like black/brown twotone leather almost in some angles but not all.. Just really confused on the piece. I've seen other sellers with these sneakers too but they looked different than this sellers (i.e. wrong coloured laces shown in pictures, etc.).  If anyone has any input on these such as from seeing reps or retail in real life on the leather colour it would be much appreciated.

Height: 5'9""

Weight: 210lbs

**MuleBuy Review (9/10)**

My Experience with Mulebuy was actually pretty great! Everything was ordered quickly, QC and photos were uploaded fats, and the shipment left their warehouse within 24 hours of my paying for shipping. The only complaint I have is that the shipping rates seemed a bit higher than others. This package with EMS30 to the United States cost me $125USD after applying their shipping coupon. Delivery was only 12 days which blew me away! Package was well protected and everything was wrapped up very nicely.

**Stone Island x New Balance 991's / ZH Batch (10/10) $37.49 USD W2C:**[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7233853817)

This was the item I was most excited about. These were the ZC President batch so I had high expectations. Once in hand, I was blown away by how nice the materials were. The small details are just perfectly done. This is a shoe I would recommend getting the higher quality batch of. The fit of the shoe is a little big. I'm a weird fit between 10.5/11US and I bought an 11. I would recommend going that half size down.

**On Runner Coudswift 3 / Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (10/10) $10.30 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7310988159)

I'm going to be honest, I had insanely low expectations for these shoes. I bought these for my girlfriend who wears ON Runner and Hokas daily. She put them on and they fit and feel exactly like her other few pairs of On Runners. She asked me to buy a handful more so she doesn't have to buy anymore for a while. These fit true to size. I'm not an expert on these shoes but I would give a perfect score especially for the price.

**New Balance 2002R Black Protection Pack/ Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (5/10) $10.45 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7310115295)

These shoes are one of two things in this haul I don't really like. These were only $10 so I really aint worried about them. I'll just end up using these as beaters. The shoe fits fine but the color is very off and the overall build of the shoe just seems off. I don't have much more to say about it. It's ight!

**Asics Gel-NYC Graphite Grey/ Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (9/10) $8.96 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7310121913)

I'm a huge fan of Gel/NYC's and have a handful in my collection already. The quality of the shoe is pretty damn good. The only complain I have is the fit is decent but the toe box seems a little longer than my models. I will wear them and use them without issue but I would size down a half size. Great colorway I wouldn't normally buy but like it.

**Aime Basketball Hat / TSARCHIVE (9/10) $8.21 USD W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=734920065504)

This hat is a great sleeper piece! This hat for the price is top notch. The yellow weather is very well done and the fit is good even for my big ass head. The only complaint I have is the bottom lettering is a ever so slightly crooked. You would only notice it if you stare at it but I don't mind.

**Kith Beanie / Martin Reps (10/10) $11.65 USD W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7318042557)

You ever buy something and you're excited at the time and when you get it, you just don't care. This is one of those items! The quality of the piece is good but its a little too small for my big ass head. My girlfriend likes the look so she's gonna take it.

**Carhartt White Beanie / Yolo66 Pandabuy Leftovers (8/10) $2.69 USD W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://shop1850717273.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7303769949)

I bought this for shits and giggles. Its was a random hat and it ended up being a Carhartt Beanie. It's not my exact style so as some of the other things, I'll pass it along to my girlfriend.

**Carhartt Socks / (5/10) $1.91 USD (Each) W2C:**¬†[**HERE**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=653734124147)

This review has a catch. One pair of socks is excellent and one pair of socks is straight ass cheeks! They are from the same seller, same listing, but two different color options. The one with the gold logo is nice and thick and fits great. The one with the black Logo is as thin as paper and the logo is stitched on crooked. You take a gamble on this one.

**Palace x Oakley Black T-Shirt / 37-Tide (10/10) $14.78 USD W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=705204955550)

Most people know the quality of 37-Tide is excellent so I wasn't worried at all. Shirt fits like a normal Palace shirt. Shirt is thick and the print feels excellent. Would recommend this for anyone looking for Palace pieces. Sorry for the terrible photo as my phone doesn't pick up black well.

**Noah NYC Core T-shirt / Pharoah AKA (10/10) $16.24 W2C:**¬†[**Here**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=669727984613)

I'm a huge Noah NYC fan and have tons of pieces already so it was easy to compare. This is a great replica of a classic Noah T-shirt. Nice and heavyweight. Tags look good. Print feels excellent. No complaint from me at all!",64,33,2025-01-19 20:37:11,FashionReps
new balance,Review : New Balance 991v2 X Stone Island Retails vs. ZOK Rep,"Hello everybody,

I want to share some pics and a quick review for the Stone New Balance 991v2 X Stone Island Shoe in Ghost White. Size is 44 for both shoes. Ordered some weeks before and finally received my haul two days ago. Retails still not worn, brand new.

Retail price was 290‚Ç¨

Rep from ZOK 339 RMB, around 45 ‚Ç¨ + shipping (WTC:¬†https://shop1784302206.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7321140350&spider\_token=bcae)

Good :

Size is like retail. Shoe looks quite good, sewing is well done. Shape and size is same than retail. Weight is also similiar, no big difference. Badge on the tonge is also quite good!

Bad:

Color is different - not 1:1 - same for the materials, it simply feels different. That's the main point for that rep - its simply not the correct colorway. Shoelaces are also different and not that thick and fat like retails. There might be some differences in the cage and sewing, but not really noticeable.

Conclusion:

Nobody will notice the color difference. Its a good rep, which I will wear from now on and sell retails. Great price for that shoe!

Uggs 9/10 

I am no expert on Uggs but they look insanely good for it's price. The materials are good and feel identical to the real ones.

New Balance 2002r 10/10

These shoes are 1:1 with very good materials and are very comfortable. Nothing to complain tbh.
[ https://k.youshop10.com/up1pql43 ]

Corteiz Air Max 8/10  
These are not for me but they look great. The materials feel in some place a little bit cheap and are not the same as the real ones but nobody will know that these are fake.
[ https://k.youshop10.com/iBNU=YXc ]

Carhartt Jeans 6/10

My least favourite piece of the haul for lots of reasons. The stitching is weird, the logo on the back looks off and the tags are bad. The fit is nice but the waist is waaay too small even though I have a small waist.
[  https://k.youshop10.com/z9X9=-1P ]

Burberry Shirt 10/10

Insanely good for it's price, maybe size up for a less tight fit. The material is insanely good and doesn't wrinkle at all.

Ralph Lauren Blue Half Zip 10/10 

The quality is very good with a nice fit and a good price. Nothing to complain.
[ https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=576627998006 ]

Ralph Lauren Navy Blue Zipper 9/10

The fit is great and is 1:1 the only reason why it's not 10/10 is because of the material that becomes rapidly dirty and attracts a lot of dust or hairs. Not pet friendly!
[ https://k.youshop10.com/iBNU=YXc ]

Ralph Lauren White Zipper 7/10 

The same as the blue one but the material is cheaper cause it's kinda see through when you wear it. For example if tou wear a black tshirt you will see it through the Zipper. I wouldn't recommend this seller.
[ https://k.youshop10.com/KKV4fdpn ]

Cole Buxton knit 8/10 

The quality is amazing for the price and is  heavy. The fit is kinda weird and is also not very pet friendly. Overall good.

Ami Sweater 10/10

Nothing to say it's 1:1.
[ https://k.youshop10.com/HDSVq5vD ]

Burberry Scarf 10/10

The quality is very nice with every packaging and with the invoice. Nothing to complain.

Mont Blanc Belt 10/10

Amazing piece for the price, it also comes with every packaging and invoice. Nothing to complain.

Arcteryx gloves 9/10

They are cheap and very good quality with goretex material like. I have kinda small hands are they feel little bit tight for a L, so size up. After -5 degrees Celsius they don't keep your hand warm anymore wich is logical. 
[ https://k.youshop10.com/Tf=EtolK ] 

Ralph Lauren Socks 10/10

Nothing to complain.

adidas samba,"Small Mulebuy haul (Sneakers, Adidas, Carhartt, Kanken)","Me: 180cm height, foot 26cm  
Used a Mulebuy - I can compare it to cnfans only. Staff is more responding, faster overall.   
$120 for 7,5kg with DHL to EU. I have also bought few Hot Wheels cars and they took care of them and packed them VERY GOOD. Recommended!  
Photos are from and agent as you see but items already have been with me for more than month.

**Carhartt Detroit Jacket** from Martin5 - $54  
Could not find any second-hand Carhartt locally in decent price so went for the rep. Comparing photos - details preserved as in the original. The sleeves are a little too long. Material doesn't seem 'cheap' . Overall 8/10. I bought M.

**Kanken Weekender Bags** for $11  
Such a great finding! $11 when retail price is over 200 euro did not herald good quality. My girlfriend always wanted a red one. After a warehouse photos I went for green one. Superbly made, the logo on the zippers matches, included a strap to sling over the shoulder. It can also do as a backpack. Multiple colors to choose from, laptop compartment inside.  
Overall for that price: 1000/10

adidas samba,Some combos that‚Äôve been working for me lately (w embuy),"Just rotating through pieces that‚Äôve held up well in both wear and style. Simple stuff, nothing too loud, just things that land right in terms of comfort and silhouette. Figured I‚Äôd throw this up for anyone looking to refresh their rotation. W2Cs are down below.



**Tops & Outerwear**

* **Carhartt Hooded Jacket**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7457669109](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7457669109) Heavier than expected. Feels like an actual workwear piece. Good length, stiff canvas shell that softens after a few wears. Wears best with anything tapered on bottom.  
* **Nike Hoodie**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7457659483](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7457659483) Not the thickest fleece, but still warm. Fit is cropped slightly short but boxy in the body. Easy layering piece. Hood sits pretty well too.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Bottoms**

* **Washed Denim Jeans**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7425194584](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7425194584) Midweight denim, not overly stacked. Slight flare at the hem. Nothing wild, just a nice cut that looks good with most sneakers.  
* **Dickies Washed Jeans**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7457647419](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7457647419) More workwear-coded than the other pair. Thick denim, high rise. They drape heavy, so better with bulkier shoes.  
* **Nike Casual Pants**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7459543458](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7459543458) Pretty breathable, sits well at the ankle. Waistband isn‚Äôt the best but it holds up. Best for low-effort days.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Shoes**

* **Birkenstocks**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432793189](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432793189) Suede texture came out nice. Not too stiff, sole feels identical to retail. O  
* **Adidas Samba OG / German Trainer Style**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435970552](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435970552) Narrow fit but super wearable. Clean stitching and suede overlays are solid. Go up one size if u are wide feet  
* **Dunks (m batch)**[ https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435950836](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435950836) Standard budget dunk. Good from a distance, passable up close if you keep them clean. Good beater.

Here's a haul I've received with all the W2Cs as usual.

Jordan 3 AMM

I've been wanting a J3 for so long, I FINALLY bought one. I'm soooo pleased with it and can't wait to dress it.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432771521

Hermes bouncing

First of all I wanted to get the leather one haha but it's my fault I sent him the wrong one. In the end I'm not totally disappointed because this one is pretty cool.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454223555

New Balance 1000

I'd been wanting a New Balance 1000 for a while but couldn't decide on a colour. In the end I took this one, even if I realise that I should have taken another, I'm very happy with it. Never disappointed by the brand, always so comfortable.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454177591

Off white be right back 

To be honest, I'm a bit surprised, despite the fact that it's probably a batch that everyone has. The shape and comfort are very good. I recommend them!

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7456150304

Nike TL x Comme des Gar√ßons 

I already had the full white colourway and loved the pair. Unfortunately, me and white make two haha.So I took it back in this colour. I'm still just as happy with them, despite a few flaws. It's ok because that's not a very, very good batch.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7456182128

Chanel CC

Ilove the shoes and the way they look when worn, but honestly I don't think they're crazy. Let me know what you think. If you agree, then I recommend them.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454298263

New balance x Loro Piana

INCREDIBLE, I highly recommend it! The shape, the quality of the materials, the way they look when worn. I love it... even if retail is ‚Ç¨5000 haha.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7432801143

Adidas Samba

Incredible, really! It's super clean, nothing to say about. My mom is very satisfied. I'm not a fan of the model, but it's so good that it's changed my mind.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435970552

Denim Tears x Stussy T-shirt 

Low grammage, so unfortunately it fits rather close to the body. It's not bad at all, because the t-shirt is pretty good.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454322453

Supreme Boxers

I'd already bought some in a haul, they're really good.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7445288572

AirPods Pro 2

As a comparison, I have the AirPods Max in retail, and for sure the sound quality and noise reduction is obviously not as good. However, it's still pretty good. I've used them 2/3 times when I'm too lazy to take my headphones, and it's really not bad.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7434289624

Acne Studios T-shirt 

Very cool, good fit but very thin. Perfect for when it gets hot again.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7454338389

Dior cardholder

It looks very good, but I don't think that the retail is the same. I gave it to my brother and he like it.

https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7435666987

   The size is right, you can hold it in your hand or wear it cross-body. The chain may be a bit long for petite people, so it is not convenient to wear it cross-body, but this is a common problem of Chanel. However, its style is beautiful and attractive.

adidas samba,adidas x Wales Bonner Samba ‚ÄúLeopard‚Äù + W2C (shipped w embuy),"
Just got these in and wanted to drop a quick review.
They came out way better than I expected. The leopard ‚Äúhair‚Äùupper feels super soft, not cheap at all. The gum sole and cream stripes are a nice combo, and the blue lining actually looks way better in person than in photos. Tongue is chunky and detailed, really good stitching all around.

Sizing:

TTS (true to size). Fits like regular Sambas.


Comfort:

Same as normal Sambas ‚Äî comfortable for casual wear, nothing crazy cushy.


QC:
Pretty much flawless. Stitching clean, no glue marks, fur even across both shoes.

adidas samba,8.5KG Mulebuy Haul to Canada üá®üá¶üçÅ‚ùÑÔ∏è,"üëã Hey everyone! Here to give my overall experience with my first **Mulebuy** Haul.

After placing my orders, Mulebuy processing was very quick to reach out to the sellers and purchase the orders. Most items took around 2-3 days to be stored in the warehouse. Rehearsal was also done quickly and as you will see **in the video**, everything was packaged perfectly.

üöÄ I used the shipping line ‚ÄúChina post-MG-JM‚Äù and it was really great. Submitted the parcel for shipping on March 22 and arrived on April 3 (*total of 12 days*). Shipping cost was $122.81 CAD for 8.6KG, which is $14.28 CAD / kg.

Mulebuy customer service was fantastic and answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly.

***‚≠ê Hope you enjoy the video I made!***

My new Adidas sneakers finally arrived! This was my first time ordering through CNfans, so I was really curious to see how it would go. Shipping was surprisingly fast, and everything was well packaged.

Both pairs look great‚Äîcan‚Äôt go wrong with classic white Sambas, and I really like the gum sole on the grey ones. I wanted to share my unboxing here since CNfans has a program where they reward social media posts.

Hi guys! I am going to do a review of my very first haul (shoutout to u/beantown_boy the format). Please, if there are any questions feel free to comment below or PM me. (Sorry for the shitty quality of the camera)

**STATS**

* Height: 173 cm
* Weight: 65 kg
* Usual size: **Small** (slim-normal fit) / **Medium** (normal - oversized fit) depending on the type of garment, I use one or the other.

**Shipping**

* Agent: AllChinaBuy
* Shipping to SPAIN
* Shipping line: Europe Duty-Free Air Cargo-B
* Parcel Weight:	7.65 kg
* Shipping Cost:	$87.18 (using Shipping Expert + $5 disccount)
* Shipping Time:       16 days

**ITEMS**

* Loewe T-shirts [QC](https://imgur.com/a/wP5iYR0) / I[N HAND](https://imgur.com/a/REH7tcp) / [W2C](https://www.aliprice.com/s?id=761828319045_221&u=BpF0BpW&c=bRFnRptojPxYKcVTFBpKBWBw0B) 3x $21

I picked up these 3 basic Loewe t-shirts from RepsBrothers (list of trusted sellers), one of each color in size S since that's what the seller recommended when I told him my stats.

They are basic t-shirts but well constructed, comfortable with the logo embroidered well, I have no complaints. No tags, and the size is normal-fit for me. 9/10 (Great Quality)

* Loewe Hoodie  [QC](https://imgur.com/a/UtxysvE) / [IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/Tiemuj1) / [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=694458788804) $36

I also chose this sweatshirt from the same seller, size S. I love it! It has been a wise decision to buy it even though I had doubts, it is warm and looks great. It has no tags and fits me normal, very happy! 10/10 (Great Quality)

* Loewe sweaters [QC](https://imgur.com/a/CzybRO8) / [IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/X8Q9BQH) / [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=738632839975) $22

To finish off the Loewe set I have chosen these sweaters from another seller. These look clearly fake since the label says ""PUTADA"" which is funny because in Spanish it means ""it sucks"", but I don't really care, I don't intend to sell them, they are fit enough to wear it without a shirt underneath. 6.0/10 (Nice but clearly fake)

Looking through the Husky catalog I saw this set of 3 Lacoste polo shirts and I really liked it. By then I had already learned how to do reverse search with images and I found this link. I have chosen 2 in size US S (should be European M) and another US M (Lacoste 3 and 4).

The blue (S) fits me well with a fitted cut, the white (M) looser but like it, and the green one (S) ridiculously short.¬† 8.0/10 (Good Quality, a bit overpriced)

I've never had a Yeezy and I wanted to try it. I was looking through this sub and saw good references of Lol2021, I contacted him by WhatsApp and bought this pair. Size 42 2/3

They are awesome, super comfortable, I didn't think they were like that. I don't know if they have flaws because I wouldn't know how to recognize them but for me they look great! 10/10 (Amazing Quality)

* Adidas Samba [QC](https://imgur.com/a/qnWy5FQ) / [IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/xbzE4yl) / [W2C](https://lol2021.x.yupoo.com/categories) $25

I've never had a Yeezy and I wanted to try it. I was looking through this sub and saw good references of Lol2021, I contacted him by WhatsApp and bought this pair. Size 42.

Like the previous ones, I liked them a lot although I think I will need to dress them up more to accommodate the foot more. Recommended seller! 9/10 (Really great Quality)

* AMI shirts [QC](https://imgur.com/a/inFYUyl) / [IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/YqJxFha) / [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=759089648770&spm=1101.1101.N.N.53e3163) 2x  $23

I found this pair of AMI shirts from a review by another colleague. Striped blue and green and white, both in size S.

I didn't expect them to be so good, they fit a little big even for a size S but it usually happens to me with shirts, I take them to a tailor to have them fitted a little and shorten the sleeves, which gives it a plus in quality for me. They have a straight cut and it goes well to wear them in different ways. I love them! 9/10 (Really Good Quality)

* Polo Ralph Lauren shirts [QC](https://imgur.com/a/caqhYje) / [IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/6FHHhoh) / [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=674036743601&spm=1101.1101.N.N.83a90d2) 2x $14

I have bought another couple of shirts from the well-known cloudshop. One in size S and another in M, although they should fit similarly according to the size chart.

The white one fits me very well, although the fabric looks different from other retails I have. The pink one does look like these, but it's a little short and maybe a little slim in the chest (you can see the gym hahahah). It goes well to wear it inside the pants with chinos. For the price, I can't complain. 8/10(Good Quality)

* Polo Ralph Lauren socks [QC](https://imgur.com/a/FurIZMm) /[ IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/1B8Xdsz) / [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=739834456191&spm=1101.1101.N.N.82f669c) 2x $6 (3 pairs/ea)

I accidentally found the yupoo from CND Island that has a lot of accessories and I grabbed two pairs of socks. They are just socks, I mean, nice. 8/10 (Great Quality)

* Jacquemus sweatshirt [QC](https://imgur.com/a/MYXx5va) / [IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/gnncOZZ) / [WTC](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=832309520931&spm=1101.1101.N.N.f503aa4) $30

I saw someone looking for this sweatshirt in another color, I followed the link and I liked this one. It's really heavy, a little oversized, I like the color. The logo is maybe not very successful, maybe that's why the price. It's ok I think, you tell me. 8/10 (Nice Quality)

* Cordoba CF football shirt [QC](https://imgur.com/a/a5w1X1v) / [IN HAND](https://imgur.com/a/nbQFSsF) / [WTC](https://detail.1688.com/offer/815132398365.html?spm=1101.1101.N.N.e81c61) $5,5

I am a big collector of football shirts and I usually buy one from every place I go. While I was putting together the haul I was in C√≥rdoba for a few days and I saw this t-shirt in their store. It cost 75 euros, I did a reverse image and found it for 5 bucks so I gave it a try. It's maybe too long but for the price is good enough  6.5/10 (Ok Quality)

* Loewe cap [QC](https://imgur.com/a/a5w1X1v) / IN HAND / [W2C](https://detail.1688.com/offer/815132398365.html?spm=1101.1101.N.N.e81c61) $4

To close the order I got a Loewe cap for 4 bucks to see how it comes, but it's a fucking piece of shit, you can see it's a shapeless trinket, but hey, I barely lost any money on it. 0/10 (Shit Quality)

So that's all folks, thanks for reading!",54,19,2024-11-08 09:31:38,FashionReps

adidas samba,[In-Hand] ‚Äì Samba OG cream (160+115 ¬•) | Ultraboost 4.0 (150+115 ¬•) | lol2021 ‚Äì Direct Shipping to Canada,"Hi everyone,

I recently ordered a pair of Sambas for my sister and a pair of Ultraboosts 4.0 for my dad‚Äôs birthday from lol2021, who I heard had good Ultraboosts (seems to work with r/Boostmasterlin who‚Äôs known for UBs). To my surprise, lol2021 also had a wide range of Samba colorways, which was perfect for what I was looking for.

lol2021 has an extensive Yupoo catalog, making it easy to browse through various options. I reached out to him on WeChat on August 16th with links, descriptions, and screenshots of the pairs I wanted. I asked about direct shipping to Canada, and he confirmed that he offers it.

- Ultraboost 4.0 ‚Äì Triple black: ¬•150
- Samba OG ‚Äì Cream white black: ¬•160
- Direct shipping (for both pairs): ¬•230

The total came to ¬•540 (around $75 USD). Payment was straightforward as he accepts Alipay or WeChat Pay. If you don‚Äôt have these options, you can use Alipay through Xoom ([tutorial](https://imgur.com/a/6OaJfwe)).

I paid on August 20th using WeChat Pay, and the shoes arrived on August 29th via China Post and Canada Post. The whole process took 14 days from initial contact to delivery (9 days for shipping). It could have been even quicker if I‚Äôd paid immediately.

- August 16th : Contacted lol2021 on WeChat
- August 20th: Placed order
- August 29th: Received the package

The shoes came in one box, and another was folded inside. I initially requested no boxes to save on shipping costs, so this was a nice surprise. If you prefer more protection for your shoes, you can likely request a separate box for each pair, but mine arrived in great condition without issues.

Since I was leaving for vacation on August 20th, I didn‚Äôt ask for QC photos or the tracking number, but everything went smoothly.

Both my sister and dad love their shoes, and even though I told them they were replicas, they couldn‚Äôt tell the difference.

- Ultraboost 4.0: My dad particularly loves the comfort, saying they feel just as good as retail. The stitching is neat and durable, and the materials are solid. There were no visible glue marks, which is great, especially for this price range.

- Sambas: My sister is thrilled with the look and comfort. The stitching is clean, and the materials feel sturdy. She‚Äôs been wearing them regularly, and they‚Äôve held up well.

I went true to size (TTS) on both pairs, and they fit perfectly.

This was my first experience with lol2021, and I‚Äôm very satisfied. He has a great selection, competitive prices, and fast, reliable service. His direct shipping prices are also the cheapest I‚Äôve seen so far‚Äî¬•115 per pair with boxes.

I highly recommend dealing with lol2021, either directly or through an agent. He‚Äôs a reliable seller with excellent prices and service.

Let me know if you need anything.

Here‚Äôs [proof of payment](https://i.postimg.cc/28hvP0H6/lol2021wechatpayment.png) if someone thinks it‚Äôs a paid review or something.

adidas samba,[Review] Valentino shoes + Ralph Lauren x Palace + Essentials sweaters + Carhartt pants and shirt + Ami shirts and polo,"Hello guys!! I am showing you my last haul!

First my stats: 185 cm and 77 kg.

About sizing:

Valentino shoes TTS

Ami Green shirt: size M a bit small, should have ordered size L

Ami Pink shirt: size M a bit small, should have ordered size L

Ralph Lauren size L: great fit

Ami polo size L: great fit

Essentials sweater size M: great fit

Carhartt pants size L: great fit

Essentials Zip Up Size L: great fit

Valentino shoes are amazing, I just love them, maybe the blue color should be a bit different but It isnt a call out for me. They are like the trendy Adidas samba but in a more elegant way. Comfortable. If I had to say something bad It would be the laces, that are a bit short.

Essentials sweaters are of good fabric quality, they will be good for this winter, material is thick and comfy, I am not an expert of this brand so if you see anything bad you can say!

Carhartt pants: The material gives me confidence, It is not thin, they have an elastic band at the bottom so you can wear them in different ways, I wanted to buy some pants like this because I don't have any of them and I am curious on how I will look in some outfits.

Carhartt tee: Comfortable, summer is over but I think I can wear It for some informal streetwear outfits.

Ami polo: a bit thin but doesnt look of bad quality, that makes It feel really comfortable. Colorway is great for different situations.

Ami shirts: I whish they were a bit bigger because they look great, I don't know yet what I am going to do with them.

Ralph Lauren polo: soft and comfy material, drawing could be better but It isnt bad at all, I have worn It two times this week and receiving a lot of views, feels great.

Clothes weight:

Ami polo: 303 gr

Ami shirts: 257 gr and 304 gr

Ralph Lauren sweater: 481 gr

Essentials Zip up: 675 gr

Essentials sweater: 727 gr

Carhartt shirt: 294 gr

Carhartt pants: 542 gr

I‚Äôve purchased from TMF. Decided to do a direct order since the PB situation. TMF is a is very helpful and responds to messages very quickly. I paid through PayPal. The shoes came in two separate parcels but arrived at the same time. 

The Air Force are for me, haven‚Äôt worn them yet as I am planning to save them for a good motive. I have tried them on they fit perfectly. I went down half a size. I‚Äôve kept mine in the box

The Sambas are for my missus. As you can see she‚Äôs worn them abit. She said they are a little tight but she likes them and is happy with them. She did size up by half a size. She normally only wears Nike or Converse trainers. She threw her box away. 

Was due to arrive on the 12/07 but I delayed the delivery by one day as no one was home. The following day I had to stay in work longer than planned but it was left in a safe place. Shipping was with Royal Mail. ",25,77,2024-09-01 05:33:28,FashionReps

Agent used was Mulebuy

Blue New Balance 2002R Protection Pack:
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7237298438
Price: $31.06
I‚Äôd give these about a 8/10. At first I thought the shape was weird as they felt so large on my feet but i believe that might be because i wear a large size (45). Other than that they are pretty comfortable and fit nicely. I normally wear a size 12 and i got a 45 and it fits nice.

Onyx Yeezy Slide:
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4480454092
Price: 16.56
I would give these a 7/10. They‚Äôre not as comfortable as the pair i got a few years back, but I guess that‚Äôs just how they are now. They look shiny at times and it throws me off because my old pair was not like that. Other than that, the looks are great.

Travis Scott AJ1 Reverse Mocha:
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6280883599
Price: $54.20
I would give these a 7/10. I did not get to try them on as they were for my friend, but they looked a bit off. I own another batch of these reverse mochas which are a bit more expensive, and these look pretty much the same. One thing I did notice though was how the laces looked skinner. Might not bother anybody else but I thought it looked odd.

ThereSkateboards SB Dunk Low:
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4284200303
Price: $43.66
I‚Äôd give these a 9/10. I haven‚Äôt owned retail and I can‚Äôt say with certainty that these are 1:1 and a 10/10, but I love these shoes so much. Favorite thing out of the haul for sure. The suede is so nice along with the designs. I‚Äôm not sure how much it looks like the retail but they‚Äôre just beautiful. The tongue is thicker which adds to the comfort of the shoes. I got a US men‚Äôs 11. Love these.

Maison Mihara Yasuhiro Hank Sole Frayed: 
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643545178846
Price: $34.33
I would give these an 8/10. I haven‚Äôt owned this specific kind in retail, but they look pretty nice. I love these shoes and they can be worn with like anything. It‚Äôs more of a specific taste as they look different than other shoes, but I like them. Only complaint is some words can be misspelled. I order some for my friends as well and every once in a while the tag or the sole has something misspelled. Other than that, the back tab is extremely stiff and it can be uncomfortable but that‚Äôs how all miharas are, even retail.

Wales Bonner Adidas Samba Silver:
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7236450445
Price: $33.12
I would give these a 7/10. They feel similar to regular sambas and fit nicely, but I feel like the tongue doesn‚Äôt really sit down by itself. It‚Äôs always a fight to have it sit and not just extend. They kind of also feel a bit thin on the outer. Not sure if it‚Äôs just me. 

Carhartt Double Knee Pants:
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=710921658192
Price: 20.32
I would say that these are a 9/10. I love these pants and the way that they fit. They have a nice baggy feel and aren‚Äôt thin at all. I also like the color. Only thing that I noticed was how the carhartt tag was ripped off the back pocket.

Maison Mihara Yasuhiro Canvas Red:
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=643545178846
Price: $35.83
I would give these an 8/10. They were for my friend and I have not tried them on. The coloring on it is nice and I didn‚Äôt notice anything misspelled.

Eric Emmanuel Shorts:
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=800235190860
Price:$17.92
I would give these a 9/10. They weren‚Äôt for me, but I tried them on and they seem very much like the retail pairs. The tag is on point, the material isn‚Äôt cheap, and they weren‚Äôt uncomfortable. These were really nice.

Ronaldinho 2002 Home Brazil Jersey:
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=602429836473
Price: $9.33
I would give this jersey an 9/10. The material is pretty nice and not cheap for $10. it fits kind of weird around the arms, but rather than that it‚Äôs a nice jersey.

Real Madrid 2014-15 Third Kit:
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=670255274000
Price: $16.88
I‚Äôd give this jersey a 9/10. I love the design and I wanted this jersey for a while. The tags are nice and the number doesn‚Äôt look bad. My only complaint is that it gets scratchy on the sides where there is some kind of stitching I think.

Brazil Special Edition ‚ÄòJesus‚Äô Jersey: 
W2C: https://detail.1688.com/offer/743574301748.html
Price: $4.82
I‚Äôd give this jersey a 10/10. I don‚Äôt like giving 10s often but this jersey is a piece of art. For $4 it came with tags and the quality is insane. Will definitely be buying from this seller again. The details are amazing, the logo is great, everything about this jersey is just impeccable. Only downside was the seller took ages to ship, but other than that this jersey is art.

2006-2007 Ac Milan Jersey:
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=671387389034
Price:$17.77
I would give this jersey a 9/10. The details are great and I like the material, but it just fit a bit too big. The number on the back also feels really plasticky. Other than that, great jersey.

FOG and Eminem Tees: 
W2C: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=675484566030
Price: $11.74
I would give these a 9/10. These were beyond my expectations and the quality was great. They feel so nice when wearing and the oversized fit is also nice. I am definitely going to cop more!",277,86,2024-08-13 14:02:35,FashionReps

adidas samba,"8KG HagoBuy Summer Haul to Europe (Big Boys Jorts; NB; Nike Shorts; North Face ""windbreaker"" Samba) - mostly text - inhand+QC photos","Hello,

After spending quite a lot of time on this sub, I decided to create a post that I would have loved to find a while ago, so here it goes.

My Stats:

* Stocky Body Type
* Height: 180CM // 5'11 - 6' during the good days
* Weight: 90Kgs Pants Size: EU XL(most common - based on fast-fashion shop's sizes(Berskha/H&M) / MEX 42 T-Shirt Size: L-XL - based on fit, L for Relaxed/Oversized - XL for Straight/Normal/Slim clothes

HagoBuy order stats:

* Weight: 8 KGs
* Volume:  (52\*28\*37)
* Shipping Fee: $101.56
* Parcel Created on 20.03
* Parcel Flight Date: 23.03
* Parcel Reaching Customs: 02.04
* Parcel Shipped to me: 05.04

Order was delayed with 3 days compared to the estimated time, customer support was very slow to reply - but it's understandable given the period.

QC photos generally don't feel like they reflect the real color of the materials  
Lenses are a bit weird and some clothes appear bigger than they are  
Also rulers seems a bit scratchy - but might be just me

Polar Skate Big Boy Pants: [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D746297487809)

M size would be the EU 42 / XL size - gone for S because I'm stupid and they looked decently sized - will try to return or give them to someone who fit.

* martials are great
* the broderie on the pocket seems of good quality
* pants length is good and can be fitted with different styles and outfits

Nike Nocta Pants: [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D711557497563)

* material is good - a bit on the heavier side
* pants feel a bit thick - more suited for winter; colder days - ass would most likely sweat if more than 15 degrees
* the cut is a little tighter in the back than the front so it feels a bit weird on the sides of your legs/butt.
* inside structure mesh

North Face ""Windbreaker"": [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D2589774863) - 2XL  
This one is a bit of a disappointment given that I was expecting something different.

* the material is comparable to the ones of raincoats rather the windbreakers
* the material is on the heavier side and would wear it more as a mountain-jacket than a lightweight windbreaker; will definitely weardown in time
* cut is a bit tight around armpits
* seems good for rainy weather
* go one size up

Autismss White T-Shirts: [Why Work](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D672179743492) // [Business as usual](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D713256743899) - 2XL

* good material for the price
* print is decent and  does not seem that it will wash away when cleaned
* go one size up - fit will feel straight if you go for usual size( Got a 2XL)

Carhartt WIP Shorts: [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D743666814599) - XL

* True to size for a straight fit (little wiggle area)
* Material feels a bit cheap and light - but it feels good for summer
* Crotch area - pockets is a bit thigh - hopefully will loosen in time

IDLT Basics Shorts:  [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D620868154884) - XL

* good material - comfy
* True to Size
* material coloring seems good and hopefully will stay like that in time.

Nike Beath/Summer Shorts: [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D693620171134) - XL

* material is good
* logo is aligned okay and no strings seem to be coming out of it
* True to Size
* well sized pockets

Mystery Football Shirts: [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D723168569818) -  New popular random set  //  New popular random set with ""star number""

* badge is well stitched
* sponsor font // player name is low quality - most likely will come off in time - i recommend hand-washing/ low washing cycles with colder water.
* comes with pants
* fit is a bit loose, could go for a size lower if you want them slim/on body.
* lucky draws - would have returned to get something that's not a very big club necessarily

Adidas Samba: [Hago Shop Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D6572739685) - 42.5

* True to Size
* they are comfortable and materials are good
* overall a very good product for the money.

**2002R** New Balance - [Hago Link](https://www.hagobuy.com/item/details?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D5297106722) - 42.5 - Phantom Black

* Hands down the best and most comfortable pair of shoes that I had
* Material and interior feels good
* True to Size
* Shoelaces are of good quality - which is not something very common for most of the shoes I got.

adidas samba,"REVIEW: Some Uncommon Pieces (Adidas x KITH Samba, Sharkbreeder NF Nuptse Vest, Wacko Maria x Jean-Michel Basquiat, FOG Essentials)","Hi everyone, haven‚Äôt posted in years, but I figured I contribute to the community again. I‚Äôve been lurking doing my own QCs and hauls for years now. These are some items from my most recent haul that contain things I haven‚Äôt seen too many in hand reviews of. Anyways here are my stats. I‚Äôm 165 cm, 68 kg, athletic build, shoe size 8, usually small sized tops and bottoms.

Adidas x KITH Samba 8th Street (green)
LINK: https://shop1697744208.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6285071588&spider_token=4572

SIZE 7.5
Probably an 8.5/10 or 9/10
The quality on the shoe itself is really nice. It has the correct insoles. The colors on the shoe are correct as well. The crepe sole texture is spot on. My only gripe with this pair is that the crepe quality isn‚Äôt as good as what I‚Äôve seen on retail pairs. It seems a tad too dark under artificial lighting but in natural light it‚Äôs perfect. I‚Äôve also compared it to my cousin‚Äôs retail pair and his is distinctively transparent where the sole meets the upper. However, since it is crepe I believe over time the wear will dirty them enough to resemble retail. Fits just like retail, which I sized down .5 from my normal sneaker size

Shark breeder/TOP North Face Nuptse Vest
LINK: https://shop1802771872.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6677196031&spider_token=4572

ASIA SMALL/US XS
9/10
Can‚Äôt for sure say it‚Äôs 1:1 since I can‚Äôt compare it to retail. However, it is quite puffy and filled with soft down feather. I read previous reviews where the tags for the vest was misspelled compared to Husky‚Äôs, but it seems they fixed that. I‚Äôve been wearing it throughout the week and the warmth is definitely great. So far there is no weird smell after using it for 5-6 days.

Wacko Maria x Basquiat Camp Collar
LINK: https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=704732632240

SMALL
9/10
Again don‚Äôt know what retail is like, but I think since this piece is so rare and old no one is going to bat an eye or know what it is. Bought it because of the cool design and the quality seems to be on par with any other camp collar I owe, nothing great to note about, pretty solid shirt.

FOG Essentials 8th season? Sweatpants
LINK: https://shop1345714763.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5520948080&spider_token=4572

SMALL
1/10
Honestly, I‚Äôve purchased from this seller many times before. He was my go to FOG seller. However I made a mistake in trusting the buy without paying attention to the QCs. When I received this, it was EXTREMELY long. The waist band was also way too small and did not stretch. This was definitely different from all the other FOG sweats I‚Äôve purchased before which fit perfectly. 100% useless unless you‚Äôre like you‚Äôre like 185 cm and like 61 kg. I just tossed it out.

adidas samba,"First Order, still confused also with order guide","Hey everybody, I am about to submit my first Haul and i am still kinda confused. Since my package is going to the Netherlands and i dont want it to get seized, i got some questions.

Package is about 7-8KG. No crazy fakes like Gucci or any other big luxury brand.

When i select Europe Tariffless Line shipping is about 105 Euro.

1. I can only declare 21 USD max isnt that a bit to suspicious? Or should i change shipping service?

2. I want to follow the guide, so do i need to fill in the requests which are mentioned:

( \[ \] If possible ask for no cardboard wrapping, let them package in DHL plastic bag

\[ \] Ask for vacuum sealing (Possible in the fewest cases)

\[ \] Ask them to wrap up your whole package with tape, a lot of tape.

\[ \] Let them put a Commercial invoice on the outside (!)! of your package

\[ \] The commercial invoice should have a value UNDER $24 including shipping costs

\[ \] The commercial invoice has to be readable, if it has printing errors it has to be printed again

\[ \] The commercial invoice has to state the shipping costs with a value >$0

\[ \] The commercial invoice has to have a sender address

\[ \] Your telephone number has to be stated on the commercial invoice

\[ \] Let them send you a copy of the commercial invoice to your email (Will come back to this) )

2. Do i need to ask for this in here?

3. I ordered Adidas Samba Shoes and Birkenstocks, should i ship them seperatly, since these a bigger brands?

4. I also ordered brands like Margiela, Maison mihara yasuhiro, Stussy and Arctery, these should be unknown for customs right?

5. Does it make sense to do Rehersal Shipping before?

# General Comments

I ordered some ‚Äòhype‚Äô items and some boring items in this haul because they were cheaper than buying retail and I just wanted to try some things out. I‚Äôm not overly worried about being called out because I‚Äôm 32 and I don‚Äôt care, but have checked other reviews/images of the items to make my comments about accuracy.

**List of items in haul:** *FK Reverse Mochas, Panda Dunks, Syracuse Dunks, Dior B23s, Gucci x Adidas Gazelles, Sambas, Converse, Hermes Oran Sandals, Essentials tracksuit, shorts & quarter zip, Goyard cardholder & AirPod case, Supreme Pill case, Tiffany money clip*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# Agent: Pandabuy

**Comments:** This is my first haul and Pandabuy was super easy and clear to use, I wasn‚Äôt confused by the process at any stage. The communication was great, including asking if I wanted refunds when sellers took ages to send. Shipping was easy and quick, imo. 

**Sidenote:** *I used After Ship to track as it had more detail for my country than 17track. It was very accurate with delivery times etc. Parcels were delivered on my end by ParcelForce.*

# Shipping

**Parcel 2:** TS Reverse Mocha AJ1, Dior B23, Dunks x2 (no box), card holder, Hermes Oran sandals. 

**Notes:**  *The vacuum bag was pointless, it wasn't actually vacuum packed, just in an unsealed vacuum bag in the parcel. Added the moisture bag as it was only CNY 5 and thought it might discourage too much rooting around in the parcel lol. Also asked them to add in foam packing material and a note saying ‚Äúfrom grandma‚Äù or something. Trying some different things.* 

*Border Force checked only the Hermes and TS boxes, they were opened and resealed with Border Force tape.*

**Notes:** *4 days to warehouse. Shipped with box because I like the box.*

The box was a little damaged, but not wearing the box etc etc. They're comfortable enough, my first AJ1 lows, not as comfortable as the highs I have (retail) and maybe don't feel quite as good quality, but quality is off with a lot of retail Nikes in general so that could just be the TS's anyway. The laces feel kind of plasticky, but idk if that's normal for this model. Suede seems ok to me, but I'm no expert. In terms of flaws, The ""Cactus Jack"" under the white swoosh is slightly misaligned compared to retail. The AIR is slightly different to retail on the tongue. But they look pretty good to me, not complaining. Obviously I could be completely wrong. I'm happy.

**Accuracy: 9/10 // Comfort: 8/10 // Quality: 9/10 // Fit: TTS**

**Notes:** *2 days to warehouse. Shipped without box.*

Shipped these without the box so they were a little beat up when they arrived, but were fine as soon as they were on feet. The Syracuse were sent with spare laces in an SB bag but not SB laces, a bit strange. In terms of accuracy, the Nike logo isn't as puffy as on retail. On the Syracuse, the orange on the liner top bit of the shoe doesn't really match well, but not super noticeable. Tags on the tongue don't seem quite right and maybe the NIKE on the back is a bit small. No major flaws and these are so common I don't think anyone will call them out as such. In terms of fit, they are close to TTS I'd say, but the Pandas are a little tighter than the Syracuse.

# Dior B23 (EU40) 

**Seller:** WWTOP

**Price: ¬•400** (+ ¬•10) // ¬£45.50 // $56.50

**Colour:** Black and White High Top

[**W2C**](https://weidian.com/fastorder.html?itemID=5317517913&spider_token=4572) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D5317517913&spider_token=4572) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/Ew94xR6) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/a/FyS83sA)

**Accuracy: 9.5/10 // Comfort: 9/10 // Quality: 10/10 // Fit: TTS**

**Notes:** *10 days to warehouse.*

Box was damaged. These are a lot more comfortable than usual 'Converse' style shoes, actually feel really good on foot. Fit a little large for me, but not much, so I'd say close to TTS. I don't think the tongue or the material have  the kind of leathery quality that the retails have but you'd have to touch it or look inside it to see that. I think the translucent layer is meant to touch on the front half of the shoe, but not too noticeable. Overall pretty good reps.

# Adidas Sambas (Size EU40)

**Seller:** 7up

**Price: ¬•134.83** (+ ¬•10) // ¬£15 // $19 

**Colour:** White and Black

[**W2C**](https://shop338847680.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6184320907&spider_token=4572) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D6184320907&spider_token=4572) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/DdV86re) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/a/vqGA6XZ)

**Accuracy: 7/10 // Comfort: 9/10 // Quality: 8/10 // Fit: TTS**

**Notes:** *5 days to warehouse. Shipped without the box and tags and they were fine when they arrived, not mashed up at all.*

There are some issues with this pair: you can see in the pictures that the suede on one shoe is slightly darker than the other (this is more noticeable in pictures than IRL), the ‚ÄúSAMBA‚Äù is way too close to the stripes, the corner of the lacing unit should be aligned with the edge of the first stripe, the tongue seems a little short but that‚Äôs not noticeable on-foot. 

Overall, it‚Äôs a pair of Sambas, nobody‚Äôs going to LC them and they‚Äôre comfy, so I‚Äôm really not bothered by the flaws. Feels like leather but smells like plastic. I‚Äôm happy with this pair for ¬£15. Let‚Äôs see how they hold up. 

# Black and Cream Converse Chuck 70 Hi (Size EU40) 

**Seller:** ezreps

**Price: ¬•150** (+ ¬•10) // ¬£17 // $21

 **Colour:** Black & White/Cream

[**W2C**](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4536177471&spider_token=4572) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D4536177471&spider_token=4572) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/qeje6to) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/a/UD9kdUz)

**Accuracy: 8/10 // Comfort: 7/10** (but I feel this way about all Converse Chucks) **// Quality: 7/10** (but not far from retail) **// Fit: TTS** (which in my experience is slightly large)

**Notes:** *5 days to warehouse. Also shipped without the box and tags and they were fine when they arrived, no damage.*

Again, some small flaws with these: star on the back tag thing on the heel is too large, sole‚Äôs maybe a little thick (idk). But again, Converse Hi Tops, nobody cares or will LC. They feel like normal Converse, where quality is not amazing. But honestly, I‚Äôd never spend ¬£85 on a retail pair of these when you can get these for under ¬£20 and they‚Äôre fine. Meant to actually buy regular Converse Hi Tops in B&W but bought these by accident, they‚Äôre fine though, happy enough with these.

# Brown Adidas x Gucci Gazelles (Size EU41)

**Seller:** Xiaorao Men's Clothing Discount Store

**Price: ¬•388** // ¬£44 // $54

**Colour:** Brown Gucci Print

[**W2C**](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=5194062761&spider_token=4572) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fweidian.com%2Fitem.html%3FitemID%3D5194062761&spider_token=4572) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/JWwWPOU) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/a/dSjXJkG)

**Accuracy: 8/10** // **Comfort: 8/10** // **Quality: 7/10** // **Fit: 1/2 size small**

**Notes:** *6 days to warehouse. Shipped with the box and stuff because I bought these for my mum. Came with the box, tags and some weird plain dustbags and one Adidas x Gucci dustbag (like for one shoe) and a carrier bag. Box was mashed up in a few places, but not wearing the box so that‚Äôs fine (*[pictures of the packaging here](https://imgur.com/a/2DE7Mhb)*).*

I love these shoes, they‚Äôre fun. As I said, bought them for mumsy but they‚Äôre a bit too small for her but fit me, so another one in the haul for me now! These look great, but do have flaws. The ‚ÄúG‚Äù of Gazelle on the left shoe is shoddy AF (shown in in-hand pics). Print of the ‚ÄúGucci‚Äù logo on the back is printed pretty badly. They don‚Äôt feel as comfortable or good quality as the plain Sambas that I bought for myself, but this could be because they‚Äôre canvas. Print looks alright to me. Tongue doesn‚Äôt feel great, and might be a bit short, but doesn‚Äôt seem too noticeable on foot. Going to buy another pair, a size bigger for mum. For ¬£45 vs. ¬£700+ mum‚Äôs happy, and now I have a pair so I‚Äôm happy too. 

# Brown Hermes Oran Sandals (EU 42)

**Accuracy: 9/10** // **Comfort: 7/10 (but they're leather sandals with wooden bottoms, not exactly comfortable shoes in any case)** // **Quality: 10/10** // **Fit: TTS but narrow**

**Notes:** *11 days to warehouse, sent QC directly (before sending to warehouse) after 7 days. Communication 10/10.*

Another pair for mum. She really wanted this pair so I looked around and Fisherman seemed to have decent ones. He had good communication, I recommend him as a seller after this interaction. He told me they were TTS and length-wise they're good but you'd need to have quite narrow feet. I have narrow feet but mumsy doesn't - so she's going to have to stretch them out a bit. 

They're leather. The stitching is maybe a bit bright-white compared to retail and the foot-pad thing is a bit square - this is common on all reps of these sandals and you can't see it on foot. They look like really good reps overall, mum's definitely not going to get called out on these and she's happy.

# Clothing

**Comments:** Ordered different Essentials bits from different sellers, wanted to see the difference and I‚Äôm mostly concerned about comfort. Added images and QC and everything so everyone can check out the stuff from these sellers for their own information. I‚Äôm not adept at legit checking Essentials so you‚Äôll be able to see the flaws in the pictures, but I won‚Äôt necessarily. For me, I‚Äôll wear most of it regardless because I can wear it at home and it‚Äôs comfy AF. 

*Also, I‚Äôve put them through the wash and reported how they‚Äôve held up after a wash. At present, I can‚Äôt vouch for any more quality/longevity than that.*

# Essentials Tracksuit (Small) - 1688

**Seller:** *1688* \- Ningbo Yinzhou

**Price: Hoody ¬•130** (¬£15/$18) + **Trackpants ¬•110** (¬£12.50/$16) *(+ ¬•12)*

**Colour:** Moss

**Accuracy: 6.5/10** // **Comfort: 10/10** // **Quality: 9/10** // **Fit: Hoody oversized, pants a bit small.**

**Notes:** *4 days to warehouse. I was aware the seller didn‚Äôt take refunds before they sent (Pandabuy agent told me ahead of time) but thought I‚Äôd go ahead and get it anyway because I know I‚Äôll wear it either at home or on school trips (I‚Äôm a teacher) that I have to go on and not worry about clothes getting messed up.* 

First the good, super warm, really nice weight to them and super comfortable. One of the most comfortable hoodies I own. The hoody is oversized and quite large on me but the pants are really tight but still comfy. I think together they look a bit odd because of the size difference (see fit pics). Pant legs and sleeves are quite long, so if you‚Äôre tall these will still work. 

**Flaws:** The main problem is the wonky and thin font on the front of the hoody. This is a bit annoying Also, inside tags aren‚Äôt great. Probably way more because these just seem fairly inaccurate all round. 

All in all, it‚Äôs a comfortable tracksuit for less than ¬£30 all in. I‚Äôm going to try another 1688 seller next time, as I‚Äôve seen some decent ones in the subreddits from there.

Held up good after a wash and still super warm, soft and fluffy. None of the print peeled or anything.

# Essentials Shorts (Small) - 1688

**Notes:** *4 days to warehouse.*

So. Comfortable. Don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre the most accurate, don‚Äôt care that much since they were ¬£6 and I haven‚Äôt taken them off since getting them. I‚Äôm not sure anyone would legit check shorts that closely, but they‚Äôre certainly not doing it to me. Will buy more, love these. Worst bag of the selection, but we don‚Äôt wear the bag.

Held up good after a wash and still super warm, soft and fluffy. None of the print peeled or anything.

# Essentials Quarter Zip (Medium) - Gman

**Seller:** Gman

**Price: ¬•235** (+ ¬•12) // ¬£27 // $33

**Colour:** Avocado (same colour as the Matcha Green shorts - think it's actually 'Sage Green' in Essentials)

[**W2C**](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=635169292933) **//** [**PandaBuy Link**](https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D635169292933) **//** [**QC**](https://imgur.com/a/ndgFxMD) **//** [**In Hand**](https://imgur.com/a/vPkb6Wy) 

**Accuracy: /10** // **Comfort: 9/10** // **Quality: /10** // **Fit:** 

**Notes:** *5 days to warehouse. Ordered a size M as this was the smallest size available from Man.* 

From Gman, seems good quality. It doesn‚Äôt feel as soft or comfy as the tracksuit or shorts tbh. This was the one Essentials item that I really wanted to get, so a bit disappointed that it‚Äôs too big for me. Ultimately, this is comedy large on me, so I will most likely give it away or sell it and have to get this from a different seller (recommendations welcome).

**Accuracy: 6/10** // **Quality: 7/10** 

**Notes:** *16 days to warehouse.*

Had to get the FashionReps classic ¬•35 cardholder. Not overly bothered by accuracy tbh but seems ok. Feels nice, looks nice. The Ys don‚Äôt touch, so maybe I‚Äôll get called out. I like it though and that‚Äôs all that matters.

# ‚ÄòGoyard‚Äô AirPod Case

**Accuracy: No idea (pretty sure this is fantasy) // Quality: 8/10** 

**Notes:** *2 days to warehouse.*

I ordered orange (I wanted something that would match the cardholder, and this is more muted and not orange like a lot of the Goyard stuff). But I needed an AirPod case, it fits my AirPods and it‚Äôs sturdy, so it does the job and looks pretty nice. It was under ¬£2. Not much more to say, might try and find one more like what I wanted but it‚Äôs no biggie.

# Supreme Pill Case

**Notes:** *4 days to warehouse.*

Just needed something to keep my meds in. It‚Äôs pretty accurate from what I can tell, but again not super bothered about accuracy - I put 9/10 because I‚Äôm sure there are some flaws but what they are idk. I will say this is very small, there‚Äôs no way I can keep all of my meds in there given that some of them are larger tablets. Also, now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs safe, I‚Äôve disinfected it so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine?

# Tiffany & Co Money Clip

**Accuracy: 6/10** // **Quality: 6/10** 

**Notes:** *4 days to warehouse.*

Needed a money clip - don‚Äôt like trying to stuff cash into my card holders. Did cut through one of my notes when I pulled it out, so I needed to pull it apart a bit and loosen it up. When I did that there was a big flaw which is that there‚Äôs a bit where the silver coating has come off, presumably from rubbing against each other (hard to describe, you can see it in the pics) and it had created a sharp bit. Filed it down with some sandpaper and it‚Äôs fine now, no more cutting the notes.

It‚Äôs not the most accurate, the engraving isn‚Äôt deep enough, it‚Äôs a bit too shiny and the 1897 is too wide. But idc, it does the job and it was ¬£3.

I'm no expert at QCing, if you see something you can mention it, just sharing pics and opinions... if you need more pics or anything just write a comment :)

ALYX tie: exactly what I wanted, perfect length, quality looks fine and has all the tags etc. Probably fake leather but it doesn't feel bad. 10/10

w2c: [tie](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=658454364392&sku=1627207:17199481243&sku_id=4931074427993)

adidas vegan sambas: with the recent prices of sambas skyrocketing I had to get me a rep pair, good quality, feels nice for 109y but sadly it runs half a size smaller. 8/10

w2c: my link is sadly dead, but you can probably still find them somewhere

suicoke sandals: great quality, wanted suicokes for a good while and I'm more than happy. idk if the sole gets a little softer or more comfortable over time but I really hope so. 8/10

w2c: [sandals](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=590838054861&sku=20549:64797379;1627207:2206272428&sku_id=4053168577908)

unbranded balenciaga batshades: with these being even cheaper than the normal unbranded batch, they also feel cheap. Might get some of the 48y batch to find out if they are the same. Still happy about them and can't complain for 7y. 10/10

w2c: [shades](https://detail.1688.com/offer/676960726302.html?sku=0:0;1:0&sku_id=4863855853909)

carhartt sidebag: bought this for cheap, feels a little cheap but we'll see how it wears in. Logo stitching looks a little wonky but man, it's carhartt. 7/10

w2c: [bag](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=615774180871&sku=1627207:7857057418&sku_id=4341214556825)

adidas gucci gazelle indoors: these were the reason I started this haul and I really can't complain. Both colors are beautiful, come with great packaging, quality is also really good and almost nothing you can complain about. Only weird thing is the toe box on the right shoe of my wine red pair being a little weirdly shaped but probably because of packaging of the haul, I added a picture of this. 10/10

w2c: [gazelles](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=679280507215&sku=20549:28393;1627207:536188058&sku_id=4872417713493)

arcteryx beta LT: needed a water and wind proof jacket and went with the newest batch of repcourier. We already have 1000 reviews so I won't have to add anything to this. 10/10

I know they're not Jordans or Dunks but whatever. 79 yuan for a classic shoe is a bargain. 

Good range of styles and sizes available and the pics looks good.

adidas samba,[FIND] Women's Sneakers Budget MEGA LIST: 100+ Sneakers under 200¬•,"/u/WaluigiIsTheRealHero here, back with a list I've gotten a number of requests for: sneakers!  

I've focused on shoes from sizes EU 36-41.  A number of these are clearance listings, so there'll only be one or two sizes in stock, and likely low numbers of stock too, so they might sell out quickly.  All of these links are from shops with at least a 20% return rate, so they're all pretty reputable sellers.  While I can't personally vouch for the quality of *all* of these, my wife has ordered a number of them so I can recommend some personally.

Without further ado, the list:

# FAQ:

* Where are the reviews? They're under ""product review"" or ""ÂïÜÂìÅËØÑ‰ª∑"", if you can't see that section, try scrolling down below the size/color selection area.
* Where are the sizes/colors? They're right below the title of the item, under ""ËØ∑ÈÄâÊã©ÂûãÂè∑"" or ""Please select model"". If you can't find that section, try clicking/pressing the grey ""Âä†ÂÖ•Ë¥≠Áâ©ËΩ¶"" button.  For listings without sizes/colors, check the item description, usually above or below the pictures provided under reviews.
* How do I purchase these shoes? Check this part of Cedaz's video [here](https://youtu.be/3YafPlqeqUc?t=189), or follow the hundreds of guides written by this great community!
* Why is the size/color I want greyed out, and it isn't clickable? That means it's out of stock, and it isn't purchasable at the moment. Try contacting the seller to see if there will be a restock.
* Why can't my agent purchase the shoes? Usually, the case is that your agent might have returned too many pairs back to the seller, causing them to refuse to sell to them. This isn't rare, Ytaopal and WeGoBuy have several cases of this happening.
* Does more reviews = better quality? No. Reviews can be easily faked, I added them as a reference number. Always check the review pictures that are provided by users, and disregard the reviews with stock images instead of actual images of the product.
* Why is there a + sign after the colorways number? That means that the seller can be contacted for more colorways, and more options are available than the ones listed.
* Why wasn't (insert cheap seller here) listed? I wanted more of a variety, so I tried to stay away from sellers like 158sir and WTG.

adidas samba,Master list of skateboard shoes,"I just wanted to share my skateboard shoes finds, and I think it's pretty complete. I didn't link taobao or weidian because they usually don't have most of the stuff yupoo has. You can probably find a few of these on tao/weidian, but it was more simple for me to just find the links on yupoo. If you want to buy these, use expert service.

The sizes are mostly 36 to 44 and sometimes 36 to 45.Prices vary from 100 to 200 yuan and is not always included. As I said, expert service will help you on these. I also included a few poser shoes(eg:blazers) because I thought they were cool. Remember to not always wear hype, these shoes are perfect to achieve a poser/skater look. Trick tip, pair with a thrasher tee, straight double cuff pants, buy a walmart skateboard and go to skateparks. Amen.

# Vans

I recommend getting the supreme collars one, because they usually are the Pro model with suede, at least retails are. Make sure the toe is suede or rubber (on all of these actually) or else they will break pretty quickly

These could be a sick pair to add to my wardrobe, they offer a more street alternative in terms of silhouette to plain Sambas or even Gucci Ace's. I know embroidery can and will likely be tricky to rep, but even from the pictures I found the embroidery looks differing and occasionally wonky from pair to pair. I just dig the black and white as well as the font, I'm also a big Pleasures fan so there's that. I think the sprawling text makes the shoe look really cohesive, yeah its kind of a lazy collab, but its sick nonetheless.",14,3,2019-03-20 20:25:01,FashionReps

All these shoes/clothes have just been worn a couple times, some none at all. I obsessed with hauls for a long time and stockpiled many things which never got worn. 

These have all been purchased over the course of many years and I always would try and find the best batches. The supreme hoodies are Teenage Club (very thick and high quality.)

Hello, selling some shoes from my closet that I have not worn in a long time. I do not know what batch these shoes are as they were bought a few years ago.. 

Shipping can vary, if you are interested you can ask me prices to your country. Obviously shipping within Ireland will be cheaper than shipping internationally‚Ä¶

**Adidas Yeezy 500 in Bone White - Size UK10.5 - ‚Ç¨30** 

Still have some life left in them, sole has oxidised over time which happens to light coloured soles.

I wore these for about 2 days and haven‚Äôt worn them since as they were a bit too small for me. ",0,2,2025-01-30 04:19:11,FashionRepsBST

KENTUCKY DUNK (BLUE) SIZE 12 - (directly from PK 3 years ago, also pretty sure I have box packed away, will double check upon purchase) used a couple times - $OLD

SYRACUSE DUNK (ORANGE) SIZE 12 - directly from PK 3 years ago, I think the box is gone, used more than the Kentucky but still pretty solid condition - 60 shipped

ST JOHNS (RED) DUNK SIZE 12 - was not PK, I think they were H12, really nice pair the toe box is a bit chunky tbh all the others are better, but still pretty good overall and rarely used - 60 shipped 

FLIP THE OLD SCHOOL DUNK  SIZE 12 - retail did not come with size 12 mens but as a size 12 I had to buy the only batch out there, haven‚Äôt used these but now the batch is extinct so üòà,  but 70 shipped

TRAVIS B@PESTA SIZE 12 - Don‚Äôt see these around much, copped a couple years ago, very good condition used a couple times, comes with the pink laces, suede is super mid but still very nice shoe- 90 shipped

PINK BAPESTA (SIZE 6 WOMENS - 240mm) from my sis but they were a bit too big only used a couple of times in very good condition, comes with blue laces also - $OLD

ROTY JORDAN 1 - $OLD

YEEZY STATICS - $OLD

@IR MAX 95 WHITE SIZE 12 - from umkao I think? Used handful of times, solid shoe but I‚Äôm replace em with Shox üíØüíØ - I‚Äôll prob only include these in another deal bulk wise or offer, I‚Äôll take like 25 

STU$$Y SPIRIDON SIZE 12 - crazy good batch from one of the good middlemen I think it might‚Äôve been Monica, very good condition and super nice fit - $OLD

TRAIL SB (***SIZE 11 MENS***- One of the only batches out there, fit really nice wish they were size 12 my true size, hardly used - $OLD 

SACAIS - $OLD


CLOTHES‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
All measurements are shown in the photos, I don‚Äôt have the charts from any of these places as they are old links either deleted or in mandarin and usually inaccurate ü§£

CAMO PANTS - mid cheap batch that was around the Reddit couple years ago, baggy but not my style anymore hardly wore em - 40 shipped 

WAXED BLACK DENIM - very skinny as well as stiffer as waxed denim tends to be, concept is great but im thicc üíØ - 45 shipped 

MNML BAGGY BLUE STAR DENIM - very nice baggy jeans for draping on your shoes but again not my style really, $45 shipped

RHUDE SHORTS - random batch from husky I think years ago, nice but didn‚Äôt fit me - 35 shipped

STU$$Y SHORTS - very basic, didn‚Äôt fit as well, will probably throw these in for anyone who buys something else and who fits them lmk I‚Äôll give it for an extra $10 

SUNDAY FLEA (CPFM) TEE SIZE LARGE - throw in with another order for free , some minimal yellowing on the neckline and don‚Äôt want it , can probably get it out

STU$$Y FLEECE - really nice piece this was the first batch ever created, one flaw is the stupid name print on the blue chest pocket melted a bit I guess when they shipped to me - 50 shipped 

GALLERY PANTS - really nice look to em, if you have big calves and are a taller a guy like myself don‚Äôt bother but if you aren‚Äôt then they are blessed, p.s they aren‚Äôt in this pic I forgot check last post for pic of them - 55 shipped

BLCG type flannel - SS22 I think, fits nice a touch cropped for my liking, has some bs screen printing on the back you can get off easily I‚Äôd imagine, waiting on a restock of an elite batch - 50 shipped 

NEW YORK HAT - $10 add on to any other order just lmk 

JORDAN 1 TOTE BAG - add on for $10 to any bundle

I'm just looking to unload some extra items and/or items I got that do not fit me well from my personals hauls. I was buying top tier merchandise and was paying top dollar to get the highest quality. I am happy with the many pieces I have kept for myself. Payment by PayPal invoice only. Tagged photos with timestamp / timestamped. Buyer to pay shipping based on cost.

~~St0ne 1sland Soft Shell R Jacket ($30) -~~¬†[~~https://imgur.com/a/8gBeQfJ~~](https://imgur.com/a/8gBeQfJ)¬†~~- bought from TopStoney and wore it a few times but it is a touch too small for me. I already ordered a new one in XL. This one is a Large and would be best for somebody 5-10 ish 160-180 lbs. Note the zipper on this one is finicky because it's missing a few teetth but you can still get it up and down. I have discounted the price accordingly.~~

~~Bu4B3rry Zip Up Hoodie ($60) -https://imgur.com/a/Va6T8WE¬†- from Thunder Fashion. Very high quality. size is L and fits me well. Worn around the house a few times and never laundered. No tags, obviously. Weight over a 1 KG. Classic grey / black checkered pattern.~~

Y33zi3 B00st 350 ($60) -¬†[https://imgur.com/a/DczmZA5](https://imgur.com/a/DczmZA5)¬†- Lightly worn but they are just a touch too big for my feet. Size is US 12.5. Probably good if you're usually a size 12 (need to size up a half to full size for yeezies).

~~K00ples Tee Shirt ($20) -~~¬†[~~https://imgur.com/a/wvPBWC6~~](https://imgur.com/a/wvPBWC6)¬†~~- This is authentic I bought it on sale at Nordstrom but it is much too small for me now. It's a size M and would be best for somebody 5'8 to 5'10 150-165 lbs. Used.~~

Gu$$i Phone Case for iPhone 13 ($15) -¬†[https://imgur.com/a/cKIR5aH](https://imgur.com/a/cKIR5aH)¬†- Don't know why I ever bought this lol. This product will not ship priority mail but rather regular mail in padded envelope.

~~Bu4B3rry Scarf ($60) -~~¬†[~~https://imgur.com/a/hsTOQTC~~](https://imgur.com/a/hsTOQTC)¬†~~- New with Tags. Comes with gift box and bag.~~",1,8,2024-09-18 07:14:23,FashionRepsBST

SHOES: No boxes unless specified

J0rdan 4 Metallic Green size 9.5: $OLD https://imgur.com/a/jordan-4-metallic-green-ipx9Xtd
Worn 5+ times. I8 batch, decent quality and upper. The sole has some heel drag and the stars on the toe are almost gone, as well as the midsole paint cracking slightly. Cages are slightly yellowed as well. Overall really soft leather and great quality midsole, no glue stains or sole separation/crumbling.

J0rdan 1 Obsidian size 9: $50¬†https://imgur.com/a/obsidians-2IWQZSk
Medium quality batch from Passersby from almost 2 years ago. Worn maybe 5-6 times I just never wore these with the colors in my wardrobe. Comfortable and leather is good quality, I will try to find the other color laces but not sure if I still have them.

J0rdan 4 Un1on Taupe Haze size 9.5: $OLD¬†https://imgur.com/a/union-4s-5EA1nPr
Worn 3 times. Fits TTS, slightly narrow. Comes with OG accessories and looks great, decent batch but some toe box creasing and wear on the sole.

N1ke SB D4nk Low Paisley size 9: $50¬†https://imgur.com/a/paisley-sb-dunk-DzGHYKs
Deadstock. Fits TTS 8.5, the padding of the SB makes it fit small. One of the back tabs has embroidery that is slightly pink, otherwise these look fantastic. Unfortunately they just fit too small for me.

N1ke D4nk Low Kasina size 9.5: $50¬†https://imgur.com/a/kasinas-7MXU9Vn 
Worn 3-4 times, ok quality. Leather creases sorta weird and the front of the toe box tends to shrink in if I don‚Äôt jam my toes at the top. Some pen marks and the most annoying thing is that the tongue is a sort of foam material that doesn‚Äôt allow me to slide on my shoes like I like to.

N1ke Saca1 Blazer White/Grey size 9: $45 https://imgur.com/a/sacai-blazer-LYQnpWf 
Deadstock. Fits TTS 9. Super budget batch, main 2 flaws are the 2nd back tab is supposed to be cream and and the side tabs are supposed to go over the bottom swoosh. Laces have a few snags on them as well. Not noticeable on feet though because the retails have terrible QC and the swoosh flaw is literally parallel to the ground.

Y33zy Boost 350 v2 Static Black Reflective size 10.5: $30 https://imgur.com/a/yeezy-boost-350-v2-static-black-reflective-etksRJO 
Worn a number of times. Soles are a little worn out. Insoles have print peeling off. Good quality rep, reflective details are 3M and boost is soft.

Jackets/Hoodies: https://imgur.com/a/sweatshirts-jackets-Onp6DVG 

Rep K1th Puffer Jacket Navy size M: $OLD
Worn twice, fits TTS. Great quality rep, warm and matte design. Very warm and puffy, soft with nylon lining on the inside. Kith branding on waist buckles, sleeve branding with 3M patch. The buckle on the right back side wasn‚Äôt stitched on when I received it so I superglued it back on and it looks a little messy (I tried to show it in the pictures).

Rep K1th Brown Box Logo Hoodie size M: $OLD
Worn 3 times, fits a TTS M. Nice material inside and out, hood and drawstrings are great quality, and nice embroidery and cuff quality that seem like they will last a while. Good color way, but fits too cropped on me to where if I lift my arms up it shows almost up to my tits.

Rep Stu$sy Black Script Hoodie (tagged size L but fits more like size S/ small M): $25
Worn 3 times, fits like a slightly cropped M. Nice material inside and out, hood and drawstrings are great quality, and nice embroidery and cuff quality that seem like they will last a while. Good color way, but fits too cropped on me to where if I lift my arms up it shows almost up to my tits.

Rep Stu$sy Black Yellow Logo Hoodie (tagged size XL but fits size M): $25
Brand new, fits like a TTS M. Nice material inside and out, hood and drawstrings are great quality, and nice embroidery and cuff quality that seem like they will last a while. Good color way, but fits too cropped on me to where if I lift my arms up it shows almost up to my tits.
Rep Stu$sy Tan Hoodie size M: $OLD
Brand new, fits like a TTS M. Thinner French Terry material inside and out, hood and drawstrings are great quality, decent quality printed graphic.

Rep @ime Leon D0re White Art Crewneck (tagged size M but fits slim size M): $OLD
Brand new, fits like a slim M. Cheap print and quality overall, pretty thin.

Rep Christian Di0r Cream Crewneck size M: $OLD

Pants: https://imgur.com/a/pants-shorts-4iB2JMd 

Rep Kapital Double Knee Pants Cream size 2: $OLD
Brand new, fits like a 30/28, low crotch and shorter inseam. Great quality all around, they have nice stitching patterns and workwear details. Measurements are 23 in inseam, 15.5 in waist, 36.5 in total length.

Retail Dickies Double-Knee Carpenter Pants cream size 30x30: $25
Fits TTS, but they don‚Äôt fit over my ass. Also they have a slight speckle effect which I have tried to show in pictures. Never worn but washed once.

Rep Nike Nylon Shorts Black size S: $15
Worn 5 times. Good quality nylon shorts but they don‚Äôt fit my thighs.

Rep Pol0 Ralph L@uren Heavy Sweatpants Grey size M: $20
Fits TTS, never worn. Nice quality sweatpants that have a heavy fleece lining, just too thick for me to wear. Embroidery and tag still attached.
Rep JW Anderson Cargo Pants size S: $OLD
Worn 4 times, good quality nylon sweatpants that fit a 32/30. They have a belt that cinches the waist and zippers on the ankles. Cargo pants with pockets and branded buttons, quality rep.

Rep Carhartt Cargo Pants size S: $18
Worn 5 times, decent quality cargo pants that don‚Äôt fit me anymore. Fits like a 30/30 but the crotch was tight on me. One of the back pockets came without a button.

Retail Carhartt Brown 5 Pocket Pants size 32/32: $OLD
Pants that are too long on me. Nice cotton material and good quality workwear pants.

Rep Cargo Pants Cream size S: $18
Fits TTS 28 waist and 30 length. I wish I sized up on these because they‚Äôre a dope design but again, they don‚Äôt fit over my ass.

Rep ‚ÄúCarh@rrt‚Äù Carpenter Jeans Brown size M: $18
Fits TTS M, I ordered these and when they came in I realized the tag on the back doesn‚Äôt say Carh@rrt but something else lmao. Otherwise great quality but not happy about the tag.

Rep Jeans with Snake Pattern Faded Blue size M: $20
Heavy denim and great quality stitching and pattern. The waist line is like a 28 so it doesn‚Äôt fit my dumpy and I only wore them once for 20 minutes until I realized I couldn‚Äôt sit down.

Rep Hole Punch Denim Pants size M: $25
Amazing quality hole punch denim which I haven‚Äôt seen much of around. Pleated front so plenty of room in groin area, could fit a 31 maybe 32 but a bit cropped so probably 28/29 length. Great pants and I wore them once but I just don‚Äôt have much in my closet to wear with.

Retail Grey Pacsun Sweatshorts size S: $15 
Fit oversized M, good quality and French Terry inside. Worn Once.

Belt: https://imgur.com/a/rep-accessories-kqzu4OW

I am taking a loss on all of these but just need to get rid of them so feel free to buy and resell for more if that's your game.

&nbsp;

$77 - [**Carh@rtt Green Faded Vintage Zip Jacket J130 from Ambition**](https://imgur.com/a/Lj7evE7) ‚Äî Size Small (Fits Oversized Medium) ‚ÄîThis jacket was extremely hyped from Ambition and took him forever to release. I got lucky and snagged the hunter-green color. It has been used only two times and is a heavy jacket. The quality is insane on this piece as well.

&nbsp;

$87 - [**Lemair3 Overcoat Black Jacket**](https://imgur.com/a/acLHgLw) - Fits Slightly Oversized Medium - Worn a couple of times.

&nbsp;

$239 - [**Monc1er Idil Puffer Jacket - JIEYI2**](https://imgur.com/a/Dk1CUWw) ‚Äî Size 2 (Fits Slightly Oversized Medium) ‚Äî This is the best batch out from the best Moncl3r seller aside from TMX.

$79 - [**Carh@rtt Green Faded Vintage Zip Jacket J130 from Ambition**](https://imgur.com/a/Lj7evE7) ‚Äî Size Small (Fits Oversized Medium) ‚ÄîThis jacket was extremely hyped from Ambition and took him forever to release. I got lucky and snagged the hunter-green color. It has been used only two times and is a heavy jacket. The quality is insane on this piece as well. I was not in a rush to sell, and shipping was pricey due to weight, so I priced accordingly. 

&nbsp;

$89 - [**Lemair3 Overcoat Black Jacket**](https://imgur.com/a/acLHgLw) - Fits Slightly Oversized Medium - Worn a couple of times. Such a beautiful piece, great for layering on top of a jacket or shirt. Quality is amazing and this piece was pretty hyped when it dropped. Paid 85 shipped from Tao so I‚Äôm eating shipping on this. 

&nbsp;

$265 - [**Moncl3r Idil Down Jacket from JIEYI2**](https://imgur.com/a/Dk1CUWw) ‚Äî Size 2 (Fits Slightly Oversized Medium) ‚Äî This is the best batch out from the best Moncl3r seller aside from TMX. Cleanest Moncl3r designed jacket ever made if I say so myself. This costs $220 + Shipping from Taobao, so around 285 total. I am selling at a slight loss, plus I will give you free shipping. This is an extremely impressive and warm jacket, but I live in the sunny part of CA, so ideally, I wouldn‚Äôt be wearing this that often. I only tried on and never used, so it is in basically new condition. Added QC pics from Taobao as well.

yeezy,[FS] [USA] 0W D^nk Low size 12 + Y33zy Zyon size 12.5,"Timestamp + Tagged Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/amt9gn7   

Not sure about flaws as I bought both pairs a while ago, use pics to judge, I‚Äôm happy to take more specific pictures upon request üëçüèº. Bought both pairs a while ago, wore each maybe 3-4 times, both have been sitting on a rack for over a year. No boxes for either pair, no insoles in the yeezys. Both pairs are about 8/10 condition

yeezy,[FS][USA] RETAIL N1K3 PR3$T0 & YZY 5OO US9,"What's good RepFam! Been awhile since I've been active but on offer are 2 pairs of retails that need new homes. The first a pair of Yeezy 500 Ash Grey's that I got directly from the Adidas app; after trying and failing everything I could come up with to get rid of a pizza stain on the front of one of the shoes I stopped wearing them, maybe one of you are more crafty than I. The second a pair of Nike React Presto Black Cat's that my ex-gf had gotten me for my birthday; we broke up and I just don't have the same affection for them anymore. Hoping to sell both together.

PayPal Invoice only. Please comment ""pm"" before actually messaging me. I work 12hr shifts Tues-Thurs so if sold on one of those days the earliest I can ship out is the next off day. I'm on the east coast so something to consider for shipping.

yeezy,[FS] [UK] Brand New Ad1das 4D Futurecraft Trainers (UK 6.5) - ¬£35,"**SOLD SOLD SOLD SOLD SOLD SOLD SOLD**

~~Brand new Ad1das 4D Futurecraft Trainers - Fit UK Size 6.5 TTS - Only tried on and they were slightly too tight (I wear UK 7). Would also be a comfortable fit for a UK 6~~

~~**Looking for the price I paid - ¬£35 (free postage)**~~ SOLD SOLD SOLD 

~~Discontinued private seller batch from early 2023, Bought because they‚Äôd been highly recommended in other subreddits.~~

Flyknit is high quality, not that usual plastic feel of other reps, but this really excels in comfort, with 1:1 boosted insoles cushioning every step, and the cage at the bottom providing strong support

Genuinely one of the most comfortable reps I‚Äôve worn - similar to that of the new BASF Yeezy 350, just a bit too tight for my foot and will likely get retail instead

|Item|Price|Sizing|Condition|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nike Dunk Coast|¬£25|UK 10|7/10|Decent condition - not an amazing batch but by no means the worst never been called out but as they have been worn for awhile the toe box has gone in on itself - easily rectified once wearing|
|Nike Air Zoom SpiridonCage 2 Stussy Fossil|¬£50|UK 10|8.5/10|i really wanted this shoe for ages and bought the best batch i could find, however in hand i struggled to find outfits for it, good condition - slight faint mark on the right shoe pictured|
|Nike Dunk university red|¬£25|UK 9|8/10|i got annoyed with the string that goes around so cut the loops out of it, still have the string but there is no loops for it to go through|
|Nike Blazer high|¬£20|UK 9|10/10|Brand new - it was a phase i was going through but in hand they didnt fit me and were uncomfy|
|Adidas Yeezy zebra|¬£30|UK 10.5|8/10|Nothing wrong with them just not really my styles anymore, worn max like 4 times, good condition|
|Nike Air jordan 1 high Pine green?|¬£35|UK 4.5|9/10|Think they've been worn once, good condition but my girlfriend wasn't feeling them - i believe they are pine green cw|

I have two pairs of sneakers to sell. I'm a newbie who bought some reps from Monica last year for the first time, unfortunately they were just half a size too small so I'm selling them! (I didn't know that sizes could actually differ...). Please see the details below:  
  
**Yeezy 350 v2 Cream White**  
  
**SIZE:** UK 11 (Note: I'm UK 11 but can feel my big toe scrape the shoe, probably more like size UK 10 or 10.5)  
**Condition:** NEW - Never worn, never taken outside. Still has the tag.

**Size:** UK 11 (Same as above: I'm UK 11 but can feel my big toe scrape the shoe, probably more like size UK 10 or 10.5)  
**Condition:** Used, good condition (used about 3-4 times until I realised it was a bit tight).

(Can ship out of US but that be extra and on buyer!)

Wassup yall, kinda gonna regret selling all of this but im in desperate need to sell these pieces as im kinda low on money from paying off my car completely (congrats to me preciate it) but In the shadow of my excitement i have a fat tuition payment coming up, skewl tuition sucks ngl, hate that abt America but again, which college student doesn‚Äôt. Much love if i can get this all bought out in a bundle or individually, might have another post with stuff I‚Äôm hesitant to sell but might need to if this post doesn‚Äôt do so great üòÖ. 

Few things to go over:

Negotiable unless stated otherwise

Shipping is free unless stated otherwise

Sold as is, anything that happens after i ship i am not responsible for.

All things will be freshly cleaned, people out here have the audacity to ship smelly shirts, i aint here for it. I respect you if you were really a customer.

_________________________________

Tops : 

Affix Shirt: (Size L but fits M better) 

pretty clean rep, simple shirt, hardly used fits more of an M then anything if you wear L its more so a tight fit

Price: 25+ shipping

Balenciaga WFP Shirt Reon District batch: (Size L) 

As said up here, its a quality batch from a quality seller (from what I remember) air dried but print is puffy and nice, slightly cracked gives it that nicely used look but to be fair only been worn a couple times, shirt has alot of life and was one of my fav reps to this date, whoever cops wont be disappointed 

Price: 35+ shipping

Vetements world tour shirt: (Size L) 

Honestly telling from embroidery this isnt a good batch, i think i bought it for 40+ from a bst seller (stupid I know) other than that the blank is clean, printing is nice, tags are cool, clean shirt for anyone who wants something simple.

Price: 25+ shipping

!RARE! Louis Vuitton Tourist Vs Purist Hoodie: (Size L)  SOLD!

I dont see these os at all, this is a quality piece, has all the right details, heavy and super comfy blank, ima really regret selling this one, used TWICE i kid you not, accurate to the eye in my opinion even down to the tags,I just always reached for my RO Hoodie in the cold, so its gotta go .

Price: SOLD!

_________________________________

Bottoms : 34 WAIST! 

Rhude Shorts : (Sz L) 

This is to nullify shipping, unless you wanna buy in a bundle i can throw these in for 5 bucks, other than that these are used, comfy but everything abt them just went down the drain, more of just a casual walk around the house short then anything else

Price: 10+ shipped
Or 
5 on top of bundle


Yeezy Season 6 Sweatpants: (Sz L) 

These are mad comfy , just dont reach for them, maybe someone else can use them, they are great quality, accurate, come with YKK Zippers to make closing and opening super smooth

Price: 35+ shipping
_________________________________

Shoes:


Bean Balenciaga Track 2: (Sz 9.5)

Great shoes, alot of life, bought these out of wanting a pair but when they came in, was disappointed because i realize i didnt like the color, I dont rock alot of bright colors. Will clean before I ship obviously so dont let the photos deter you from buying.

Price: 80+ shipping firm (heavy asf sorry) 
No box unless you want a replacement

Yeezy Oreo 350‚Äôs (Sz 9.5)

Love these, but i lost the trade on these tbf, i traded by TS 1 Lows for these, come to find out they‚Äôre missing an insole, and the other insole didnt fit the shoe right, other than that, this shoe is great worn like twice, again dont let the photos deter you i will clean these before i ship them out

(Side note: Ive been super busy with school and work  I took the laces off to clean and I just havent had the time to re-lace so now you can lace as you see fit) 

Price: 60+ shipping 
With box and laces

_________________________________

Accessories:



Sicko Hat:

Semi Accurate as color of bill is off, hat is nice , just haven‚Äôt worn after I didnt like the fit on my head , adjustable, smooth fit

Price: 20+ shipping

!RETAIL! Working On Dying hat! 

If you‚Äôre a big wakeupfilthy fan, carti fan, lonely fan, ken fan, etc. this hat goes for 100+ on grailed, which is kinda absurd imo, im more into fitted hats so obviously this hat didnt make the cut, get it for a steal! 

Price: 40 shipped firm

A-Cold-Wall Bucket Hat

This is pretty rare in my opinion, i dont see it at all, but its cool for the right head, i got a fat head and didnt enjoy it, looks accurate, in terms of details, but i cant find a retail reference? Sooooo‚Ä¶ im not sure if fantasy or just a rare drop

Price: 25 shipped! 

Thank you for looking! Take all for 400 , Bundles are always appreciated

**A couple of things to note before buying. PLEASE READ:**

**Vouche‚Äôd Seller** Zelle, Paypal friends and family, Venmo, or Apple Pay Shipping from NJ as a heads up to the west coasters. Will be shipping beginning **Monday August 21,2023 through Friday August 25, 2023.** I am unloading a good amount of stuff so it will take time to ship everything out. At the time of purchase I will let you know when I anticipate shipping. You must comment **PM'ed along with the item or items you're interested in PRIOR to messaging me.** I will only respond to messages of those who post here first, and in the order that they are posted. If you don‚Äôt have enough karma to post, please do not message me. It keeps me from reaching qualified buyers in a timely manner.

* [CLICK HERE FOR VOUCHES](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepVouch/comments/hiq0ju/ujdfrenchbread23_vouches/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). New vouch thread coming after this sale. Check my post history for more recent BST listings. [New Vouch Thread as of 1/2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepVouch/comments/s03hiq/vouch_for_ujdfrenchbread23/)

PRICES ARE FIRM UNLESS YOU HAVE PURCHASED FROM ME IN THE PAST. If you are a repeat buyer we can discuss multi pair discounts. If you are new buyer only discount will be for combined shipping. If you have flaked on me in the past I probably won‚Äôt respond to your PM. 

Not all Batches are identified. If I know what the batch is I will call it out. Even with the batches not identified these are all high quality batches. Don‚Äôt take my word for it. Look at the Tagged photos Time Stamped separated into 2 albums

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nike Dunk Coast|¬£25|UK 10|7/10|Decent condition - not an amazing batch but by no means the worst never been called out but as they have been worn for awhile the toe box has gone in on itself - easily rectified once wearing|
|Nike Air Zoom SpiridonCage 2 Stussy Fossil|¬£50|UK 10|8.5/10|i really wanted this shoe for ages and bought the best batch i could find, however in hand i struggled to find outfits for it, good condition - slight faint mark on the right shoe pictured|
|Nike Dunk university red|¬£25|UK 9|8/10|i got annoyed with the string that goes around so cut the loops out of it, still have the string but there is no loops for it to go through|
|Nike Blazer high|¬£20|UK 9|10/10|Brand new - it was a phase i was going through but in hand they didnt fit me and were uncomfy|
|Adidas Yeezy zebra|¬£30|UK 10.5|8/10|Nothing wrong with them just not really my styles anymore, worn max like 4 times, good condition|
|Nike Air jordan 1 high Pine green?|¬£35|UK 4.5|9/10|Think they've been worn once, good condition but my girlfriend wasn't feeling them - i believe they are pine green cw|
|AIR JORDAN 1 RETRO HIGH OG Obsidian|¬£25|UK 9|7/10|Not really my style anymore to be honest, not an amazing batch but could be alot worse, never been called out for them|
|Nike Air Presto Off-white|¬£50|UK 10|7/10|Okay condition - very comfy and i believe they were from coco - just not into them as much anymore come with extra laces and tag|

air jordan,[FS][CAN][USA][WORLDWIDE] MASSIVE HOLIDAY SALE,"Hello fellow Repfam,

I hope everyone is having a great holiday season so far. I have a bunch of items to sell that I have collected over the past couple years. I wish that I could keep these items, but given how much university is going to cost even while working a job, I just cannot afford to have them in my closet. I am selling mostly rep items, with a couple retail mixed in. Even if they are retail, I hope to sell them at rep prices so I do not tax on my items. I hope that all my prices are reasonable, but if they are not feel free to send me an offer on any of the items that I have available. I have most of the boxes for the shoes, so I can probably find the replica box and send it along with the shoes. Do not expect a box to come with them, I threw some of them out. The ones that I did not throw out I will send with the shoes. Some insoles are missing, and I will try and find replacements for those that are. I will ship all the items for how much it costs me to ship them to you for. I am comfortable shipping anywhere in the world, and am shipping out of London, Ontario. All items will be SHIPPED SAME DAY unless the post office is closed. If you have any questions at all, feel free to chat me or PM me. Paypal Invoice only and all prices are in USD. Sorry for the agent photos, I just had so many items it was the easiest way to do it. Not all items fit true to size, go up a size if unsure.

With that being said, here is my tag and timestamp for all the items:

Shirt will come first, then jerseys, sweaters, jackets, shorts, pants, jewellery and then finally shoes

- LJR Air Jordan 1 Off White UNC size 11 - 110$ shipped lightly worn and remarkably close to retail. Very good heel cups, AIR texts, no USA flaws, good slight natural yellowing to the foam, they honestly look real.  
- H12 Off White Michigan Dunk size 11 BRAND NEW - 130$ shipped one shoe was tried on for fitting but they were never worn. The leather is remarkably plush and high quality, I'd go as far to say the leather was better than a retail I saw in a consignment shop. Only reason its 130 shipped is because I never wore them and I want to get close to what I paid. With shipping prices you are looking at 140-150 to get a pair over from China, and that's before the recent covid explosion over there
- UABAT Air Jordan 1 Union Storm Blue size 10.5 - 110$ shipped only worn maybe 3 times. The suede on the swooshes are very good and the materials are all great. This pair is from early 2021 stock when UABAT's pairs were very highly touted. The left UNLA tag is missing the stich above as you can see in the photo, not sure why uabat did that to your boy.

**Haider Ackermann Black Velvet Bomber Jacket - $135 shipped**

* size small, fits like TTS medium
* condition: 9.5/10
* this is the version with correct olive lining and the best version of the black rep. I have retail burgundy in hand here are the differences:
   * rep does not use real raccagni zippers (they are branded as raccagni tho)
   * rep's ribbings (neck and cuffs) are thick but not as thick as retail
   * velvet fabric is up to par with retail quality
   * back of the jacket silhouette does not ""come out"" as much. imagine: ""("" vs ""C""
   * not nearly as cropped as retail, but this is because retail overall shape is more ""rounded"" (see above point)
   * overall jacket is a bit thinner than retail

Also bought from Coco. Think it's a GD batch too. Pair has also never been worn outside, just to try them on inside is all.

FAQs:

Q: Do you ship to the US?

A: I do! Shipping is also rather affordable as well, so feel free to DM me for prices!

&#x200B;

Q: How long before you ship?

A: Orders via regular will be shipped next working day unless otherwise communicated.

&#x200B;

Q: Why is there an additional % on my invoice?

A: Unfortunately, Paypal fees are horrendous, I could build the % into the original price but I like to be transparent with my prices!

&#x200B;

Q: Why are your prices set as such?

A: I love a good bargain as much as you do, so I try to sell my stuff at low prices for fellow repfam to enjoy! However I am not running a charity, I sell my stuff below cost price + shipping, then I remove value according to the item's condition.

&#x200B;

Q: What currency are your items listed as?

A: Listed in USD, will provide conversion to SGD if requested!

&#x200B;

Q: Will the item fit me?

A: I will do my best to help you with the fit, for reference my stats are 182cm, 70kg, shoe size US9.5-10

&#x200B;

Q: What are the flaws on the stuff you sell?

A: Any flaws I'm aware of will be stated, if you ask me for the flaws and it isn't stated I'm just as clueless as you; I post multiple pics for you to do your own judgement.",2,10,2022-03-18 06:32:08,FashionRepsBST

**Size 11** \- Brand new

**Note:** This is from the batch that Bat had people waiting months for that ended up having pink tongues. Upon receiving my pair, I masked off the shoe and performed a meticulous ""bleach fix"" to remove the pink hue and leave the tongues the necessary off-white/cream color.

I also replaced the short laces the pair came with with a correct pair from Lacelabs.

First time using this subreddit. As most here I over spend a bit last year when I first discovered reps, these two pairs have been sitting in my closet taking up space and collecting dust for the past 6 ish months and it's time to let them go and recoup some of my money I over spend.

Bought these from Coco, I think it is GD batch not sure. Pair has never been worn outside, just to try them one when I received them. Replaced the laces from black to white one time and I used it to take photos in my studio. Box has extra white laces with them, black and red. Box is in good condition also 120 euro + shipping

Also bought from Coco. Think it's a GD batch too. Pair has also never been worn outside, just to try them on inside is all. Replaced the laces from black to pink to white once to take photos of them in my studio as well. Box came in damaged ( as seen on the photo ) but besides that all the laces + special paper is there. 120 euro + shipping.

Stats: ~157lb 5ft8in, slim athletic build

Selling because I don‚Äôt wear these pieces anymore and I got bills coming up feelsbadman.jpg. Shipping is included in price. 

*SOLDDD* Dior sweater size M $40 shipped obo - Bought this off BST over a year ago and worn maybe 4 times max. Washed it once and the tag came off on one end (see pics). Feels nice as fuck, length wise right at my waist but I like things slightly more oversized. 

Gucci Track Jacket size M $40 shipped obo - Bought this off BST about 2 years ago. Lots of compliments but a mutual female friend said she wouldn‚Äôt approach me cause she found it intimidating. Baby if I look outside your tax bracket just say that. Anyway, there‚Äôs some stains (see pics) I believe could be taken out but I‚Äôm vehemently lazy. 

*SOLDDD* Gucci Stars ski mask OS $35 shipped obo - Again, bought this off BST years ago. Haven‚Äôt seen many pop up since. Cool piece, I just don‚Äôt wear it anymore. I have a Vlone one so I don‚Äôt need this one. Ships in time for Halloween lol.

*SOLDDD* Retail Asics honey colorway size 9.5M $40 shipped obo - I‚Äôm more negotiable on these. They just sit in my closet. Overall 7.8/10. Double box would be extra. Offer away the worst I could say is no ty. 

*SOLDDD* Gucci Tiger tennis shoes size 10M $40 shipped obo - I‚Äôm a TTS 9.5 and these fit *slightly* big, like half a toe in the toebox area. Numerous compliments on these too I just prefer 1s.

~~These are PK batch~~ [~~originally purchased from Monica~~](https://imgur.com/a/67eWHXb) ~~that came out to $138 after shipping and fees. VNDS condition and only tried on for fit indoors. Realized I need to go half size up for 700's. If you don't know sizing for 700's they are snug so these are tight US 11 and probably better for a 10.5 but double check insole measurements provided in the last pic. Does NOT come with original shoe box and will ship in a spare Jordan 1 box that was kinda beat from shipping.~~

**Retail: Asics Gel Lyte III Wood Crepe Blossom US 11**

Bought these straight off Asics website. This pair sold out online and is going for [$160 on StockX](https://stockx.com/asics-gel-lyte-iii-wood-crepe-plum-blossom?country=US&currencyCode=USD&size=8.5&gclsrc=aw.ds&?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=OD-Segment-Sneakers-AdultSizes-(US)&utm_campaignid=1032998786&content=244607812448&keyword&gclid=CjwKCAjwtJ2FBhAuEiwAIKu19rjXyrz70UbnDN3mdVpklUmIyFaOlyFUveURZuh008d8s6hb-gFYshoCtPYQAvD_BwE) before shipping and fees. Deadstock but don't have the original box as it got damaged from shipping. For some reason Asics is like rep sellers and didn't double box it. Have a spare Nike box to double box it. Asking for $160 shipped.

Both pairs will be double boxed via USPS priority mail and I already include shipping in my asking which usually runs me $15-20. So pretty firm on prices.

GUIDELINES:

* (P) indicates pending. 
* **First in best dressed**, no holds. Only exception is if you're waiting on a response from me. Come Paypal ready if you want some steals.
* Asking for an invoice implies you're commiting to buying. Pulling out after receiving an invoice is flaking, and wastes my time, your time, and other buyers' times. I have nothing against pulling out before receiving an invoice though :)
* After I leave (on Thursday, last shipping time is Wednesday afternoon), I'm still happy to sell items, just know that I won't be able to ship them out for a month or so.

Shipping can be done in a few forms ranging from prepaid satchels to double boxing. Double boxing etc will cost more however. Also, shipping is very expensive outside of Australia, so please keep that in mind if you're interested - here's how much it costs (in AUD):

1kg - $35

2kg - $61

3kg - $70

4kg - $78

Shipping can be done in a few forms ranging from prepaid satchels to double boxing. Double boxing etc will cost more however. Also, shipping is very expensive outside of Australia, so please keep that in mind if you're interested - it's roughly $30 a pair \~

\--------------------------------------

**Astroworld Nike Tee              SOLD TO** /u/villavisuals

$20 Worn twice, washed twice, sized medium. Ambition batch so its the  best.  I think this astroworld tee is family and friends only, every time I wore  this  shirt I flexed and mad ppl asked about it. Nobody has this shit  unless  they repfam, this is my fav, def ordering a Large.

\--------------------------------------

**OW x Nike Off Campus Long Sleeve             SOLD TO** /u/villavisuals

$25 Never worn. Sized Medium, fits like a small medium. Union Kingdom batch, best of batch out there. Not much explaining to do.

\--------------------------------------

**BAPE x NBA Lakers Tee**

$25   Never worn. Sized Small, fits oversized like a medium. Got from   0832club a few months back. The quality on this is actually really nice,   its Mitchell and Ness too. Still kept the 46 tags it came with.

\--------------------------------------

**Nelly Basic Tee**

Free 99. Sized M never worn will throw in for free Tan colored I think?

**Acne Studios Logo Tee                      SOLD TO** /u/villavisuals 

$15   Never worn. Sized Medium, I don't remember where I got but its a  pretty  basic shirt. Nice blue color, but theres some pure white stain  on the  shirt that could probably come off with a wash I don't even know  how it  got on there.

**Dragon Ball Z Primitive T-Shirt**

$5   Worn like 3 times its way to small for me.... Its a real small, I  don't  remember where this thing came from but its been sitting for  awhile. If  it doesn't sell I may just put it in someones package. But  the print is  pretty fire

\--------------------------------------

**2018-19 PSG Home Jersey**

$20 Never worn. Size Medium. I think I got from aaajersey's a few months back, its pretty much like retail.

\--------------------------------------

**Majestic NY Yankees Jersey**

$20 Never worn. Its big, sized 48. I didn't mean to order it this big but   w.e. It has nothing on the back, the front just has a Yankees logo,   thinking about keeping it and wearing it over my sweaters...

\--------------------------------------

**Nike Tech Fleece Joggers**

$25   Never worn. Sized Large but fits Medium. Same batch everyone else has,  I  used them for the big pocket to hide my carts in the closet.

**Palace Reflective Shorts**

$20 Never worn. Size Medium tags still. Dope shorts, They got some reflective zippers.

**Retail Adidas Track Pants White**

$25 Never worn. Size S, Climacool material. Bottom is taped with a zipper. Everyone has the black pairs but what about white?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Accessories**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Salmon Toe Asic Gel Lyte III 1.0s**

$75   Never worn. Size 9, I have box and pink laces. These were my grails,   they look good and I kept them in shoe trees for a while.

\--------------------------------------

**C.P Company Google Cap**

$15   Never worn. I got from Top Stoney, its like a normal baseball cap but   there are clip on googles if you flip it. Just a little too small for  my  big head.

\--------------------------------------

**Retail Adidas NMD Toykos**

$30   They are beat. Size 9. I am gonna be honest these are pretty dirty,   like 6/10 but i still rock em. There is loose stitching in some places. I   think I have the box somewhere but id rather not ship them with box.

**Retail NMD Reflectives**

20$  Size 8.5. Like the ones above, they are beat. I would say these are   more used then the ones above... I did everything in these two NMDs,   played basketball, football, hiked, walked, everything I did in these.   Im listing them because why not. Once again i have the box somewhere but   id rather not ship with box. Also realized I forgot photo of sole....

[Tagged Photo:](https://imgur.com/a/gM3CkQK)

Welcome to the ‚ÄúWho let me buy these I either hardly wear them or never put them on so I should get them out of here so I have more room for activities‚Äù sale! As the sale entails, most items are either never or hardly worn and are taking up space. So here we are.

All prices can be negotiated very slightly, but keep in mind they (for the most part) are pretty much ‚Äúas bought‚Äù plus a wash albeit wrinkling from storage. However, I encourage taking multiple items and I will make decent cuts on said bundles.

Trades are also welcome, but since I'm more looking to get rid of things I would much rather sell them, or trade multiple pieces for an equivalent single piece (chances are I will trade more value on my end just to offload items). I have below a few reps that I have been looking at that I would be happy to trade and be lowballed for, in order interest. Other good trades can be considered.

[Cav Empt Desires:](https://imgur.com/a/ruK1HRJ) 
From DNTM a couple months ago. For such a large hoodie it‚Äôs relatively thin, but the same blank in green has easily become my favorite hoodie I own so don‚Äôt hold it against it. The print is 3M and the badge is properly dyed.

[Vetements Gemini:](https://imgur.com/a/1EUCtJu) 
Unlike Stoney this size chart was wildly unreliable so it‚Äôs too small for even my lanky ass. The print is good, however, and the blank feels like it would be very nice if it wasn‚Äôt also a compression shirt on me.

Size: 9.5US, fits big like retail timbs, I wear 10 in most sneakers.

Price: 50 CAD + Shipping(shipping will probably be a lot since its a heavy boot) or Best Offer 

--------------------

***Asics Gel Lyte 3 Black / Tan with 3M***: Never had retail asics but I liked the aesthetic and they seem pretty well made, only worn a couple times.

Size: 11US but fits me nicely, I wear 10 in Nikes. Most likely the seller told me to size up otherwise I wouldn't have gotten an 11.

my financial aid hasn't come in yet and i don't wear any of these anymore so these things will fund the access codes i need to get lol, ill ship asap on the following day, if i'm not able to then the day after. prices include shipping, if you need more photos just pm me, i wear size 11/45 and all the shoes listed here fit me just fine 

REPS:

Supreme CDG split BOGO shirt: SOLD , size Large, blank is really comfortable, it was a budget batch so its not perfect

Supreme Akira white tee: SOLD, size Large, it will fit a large but its short length wise, would probably be better for someone who wears a medium or someone who prefers shorter length

158sir Harden 1 LS: $30, size 45, they fit TTS, worn a few times, comfortable shoe, cant give any input on how they'd perform basketball wise but they're a good casual shoe   

BMLin multicolor UB Mid: $55, size 45, fit TTS, worn twice, walked with them into finishline and compared with the ones they had on display and they were 1:1

Tech Cargo Pants: $35, never worn, Fits 30-32 waist and the length is more of a 30 probably, but it depends if you want them cropped up or not

RETAIL:

Nike zoomfly SP tokyo: $50, size 11.5, worn twice, haven't ran in them, they're too narrow for my feet, comfortable shoe otherwise

ASIC GEL-LYTE SPEED: SOLD, size 12, found these in a thrift shop a few months ago, i can fit into them and i wear a size 11, so size 11-12 people can easily wear these",1,6,2019-02-03 14:37:43,FashionRepsBST

asics,"[FS][USA] Nike, Adidas, Asics (REPS AND RETAIL) Size 11 US","Clearing out some of my collection.

Payment will be via paypal invoice, USA shipping only. Anything purchased tonight ships tomorrow morning. All prices include shipping WITHOUT BOXES. All sneakers come with free cat hair.

I don't know the flaws, so please don't ask.

&#x200B;

[Pics are here fam](https://imgur.com/a/cefTXPB)

&#x200B;

I'll entertain offers via PM.

&#x200B;

**REPS:**

&#x200B;

~~Nike Vapormax (11 US), purchased from CSS quickbuy list. Worn about 10x. $50~~  **SOLD**

&#x200B;

~~Adidas x Wood Wood Ultra Boost (11 US), I don't remember what factory I purchased these from. Worn, but great condition. They will come with the blue/orange laces. $60~~  **SOLD**

&#x200B;

Adidas Overkill EQT 93/17 (11 US), PK God batch. These were my beaters for awhile and are pretty smoked. Boost is discolored, and they show a fair amount of wear. $30

&#x200B;

Adidas Yeezy 350 Beluga (11.5 US), David's batch. This is the batch that finally fixed the stripe height. Worn about 5x, boost cracked a tiny bit on the bottom of the left sneaker, so i put a bit of glue on there, but haven't worn them since. I'm sure with a little regular wear, the glue won't be noticeable. $75

&#x200B;

**RETAIL:**

&#x200B;

Adidas x Parley Adizero (11 US). Worn less than 5x. I think they fit a bit small and would fit a 10.5 better, I never bothered to try them without the insoles because they were an impulse buy that I'm not in love with. $50

&#x200B;

Asics Gel Lyte V (White/Black, 11 US). Worn less than 5x. Not really crazy about them. $50

&#x200B;

Asics x Undefeated Gel Lyte V (11 US). Worn less than 10x. They're strange and get some attention. $60",6,0,2018-10-19 16:08:33,FashionRepsBST

asics,[FS][USA][HTX] - used feet devices reps and retails,"all pictures including tagged pics can be found right [**here**](https://imgur.com/a/juqKCFl)

going in order i've got a few reps to get rid of, i'll try to clean them before i ship them out:

# REPLICAS:

**off white air jordan 1's chicago cw size 9.5** \- 8/10 condition, maybe 9/10 with a clean?? color bleeding is minimal after being worn for about 5 times, these are will's 3rd batch so their only big flaw is sloppy stitching and the usa placement, fits tts 9.5. i actually just put these up because i wanted my tagged pic to look more even LOL. looking for **110 shipped** with box and extra laces.

**386 yuan taobao batch off white prestos size 9.5** \- 9/10 condition, worn out three or four times, there's a few dirt marks that can be scrubbed out, shoes are really comfortable, flaws include but are not limited to: shiny swoosh, cage flaw, and mesh orientation being wrong. selling these cause they fit more like 10 and slip off my feet sometimes yeet. box is not included, box was destroyed but all laces are, looking for **50 shipped**

**muks salmon toes size 8.5** \- 6/10 a lot dirtier than i'd like, there are scuffs and dirt marks on the nubuck areas and the inside liner is in dire need of a lint roller. flaws include nubuck areas that should be suede, the asics logo on the midsole being ""dodgey"" and weird looking, and the logo mesh area on the back. these run a little small, feels more like an 8 than an 8.5  no box included looking for **30 shipped** on these.

# RETAILS:

**NEW extra butter x saucony 'for the people' size 10** \- tts, i really like these but they're just too loose for my liking, super buttery suede, the details and quality is just amazing, they've only been tried on, never worn nor kept out, looking for **110 shipped** with everything included

**NEW ozweego 3's in purple mist/black size 8.5 AND 9** \- i got both to see which would fit me better, they're both pretty similar the 8.5's actually fit really well, the 9's have not been tried on and these are both now no longer on sale on any retailers for a decent price. i love these, gonna be my main kicks, and so i only need to get rid of one pair. everything included looking for **300 shipped** to stay ahead of retailers and stockx. 

**old school 2010 gucci high tops size 7.5-8.5** \- these are uhh, hella old, i remember wearing these less than 20 times for sure in middle school yeet, but they look so beat from age, i guess they're vintage LOL?? these are hella cute bro, there are stars on the sole and the logo is all stamped on the shoe, leather quality is so nice and has retained its smoothness. sizing on these are freaking weird, i'd say they're long enough for a size 8.5, but not very wide. **100 shipped** or i'll just keep.

**deadass solo 3 beats in matte black** \- yeah so i've had these for a while, i used them once during my finals and they destroyed my temples, not recommended for glasses wearers. they're still pretty new, i just need to rename the device or remove the name when these link to a new phone looking for **120 shipped** ",6,11,2018-07-27 14:43:53,FashionRepsBST

**Salmon Toe Asics**: Bought from a random Taobao store that is now dead since Umkao was out of stock. It's all the same batch. Size 11 but fits like a 10.5/10 (I am wide foot TTS 9.5 and fits me on the width but there's a little extra toe room). Tried on for fit indoors. Bought for ~$50 shipped and I'll sell for **$50 shipped**.

Also Selling God Batch PK V2 OT US9. Asics were used few time, upto 5 max, same as Nikes, they feet the same, Nike TTS, Asics .5 smaller. I wore God Batch OTs 2 times, really can't fit it with anything, it's size US9, fits like 9.5.

Prices:

Asics - 35 euro

Nike - 40 euro

OTs - 75 euro

Prices don't include shipping or potential fees, I'm EU based. If you buy ""in bulk"" we can work something out.

I also was lucky enough to get Beluga 2.0 in size 9.5, it's DS, I'll sell it probably, but if I get some good trade offers I would maybe consider it (for an example 2 pairs of God batch reps of 350 v2, DS, and shipped from Europe).

asics,"[FS] (US-FL) Pirit Floral Gucci Ace size 43, HKS Rick Owens Ramones Low size 43","First off let me say the Gucci Aces fit a bit smaller than the Ramones. I took the Gucci insole out and replaced it with an ASICS one of the same size and they fit better and probably more comfortable, I haven't worn these outside of the house, only tried them on. I will include this insole with your purchase, because quite frankly the Gucci insole is thick as fuck, and incredible stiff/uncomfortable. I left the Gucci insole inside the shoe in case you'd rather have that.

Also, as a disclaimer, I tell Superbuy to throw away all boxes when I get a shipment. I don't have the Gucci box, or the Rick Owens box, I'll use a random shoebox I already have to ship them, and they of course will be double-boxed.

Today I have for sale two pairs of shoes. I've worn the Ramones low tops out twice and the Gucci Aces have only been tried on in my room. I walked around in circles a bit around my bed.

The Gucci Aces can be yours for $100 shipped, the Ramones will be $50 shipped. Paypal invoice.

I'm willing to sell them as a packaged deal for $140 shipped.

I paid $125 for the Aces from Pirit and $70 for the Ramones from HKS, considering both of these are very close to deadstock this is a steal for anybody interested in these shoes.

~~Up first is a Palace 3M triferg, believe I got this from UNHS a long time ago. Has been worn and washed somewhat, and there is very minor cracking on the back print. Size L, fits fairly TTS. Looking for 25 shipped.~~

Next is a vetements SS16 longsleeve from Reondistrict. Size S but fits like a long XL. No tags, as Reon does, however the rest of the shirt itself is 1:1. Only ever tried on before realizing its not really my style. Go for like 40 + shipping from Reon, looking for 30 shipped.

~~Next is a piece that I have loved greatly, but sadly dont wear anymore. Its an Off White jean jacket from one of their earlier seasons. Size M, fits like and XL, nice thinner denim material good to layer a hoodie under. Looking for 50 shipped.~~

~~Next is a TC black tonal bogo. Bought this off of here and have never really worn it. In great condition, practically no flaws to be spotted. Is missing the washtags inside of the hoodie however. Size XL, fits like a L. Looking for 65.~~

~~Next are some Of the Ronnie Fieg Asics Volcanoes from MUKS. Size 10, worn maybe 2-3 times. Easily one of the favorite colorways of the shoe. Fits true, maybe a half size small if anything. Looking for 50 shipped.~~

~~Next is an Off White crewneck from Cesar. Fits about a M. However, my brother wore this once and somehow managed to get a stain on it, and unfortunately, I'm a mix of too lazy and my apartments washer is garbage. However, should be fairly easy to get out with a good wash and spot clean. For that reason I'm letting this go real cheap, 20 shipped.~~

Finally are a pair of bred V2s, which I also got off another user on here. Size 10. Believe this are from Cathy? Not positive, as the listing was deleted. However, they are practically indistinguishable from retails as far as I'm concerned. I paid 165 for these, and since I have worn them a couple times, I'm looking for 135.

Prices are negotiable, first come first serve. Check my profile for past sales.

I've been so MIA on the repgame the last two years because my closet is absolutely overflowing with pieces that I don't wear enough. So, here's your chance to snag a ton of clothes, jewelry, accessories, etc. that have hardly been worn! I unfortunately don't remember the exact batches and such for each piece, but I've tried my best to describe them in terms of quality. A lot of this stuff I've not worn since buying so most of it is lightly worn or brand new!  
I also have some dope retail pieces some of you might be interested in, so be sure to check those out!  
Several rare and unique pieces, so please buy away!

# CLOTHING

[**0ff Wh!t3 ""Seeing Things"" Black Sweatshirt**](https://imgur.com/a/ocBCLEn)  **| $26 shipped**

* Size S
* Low-tier rep ‚Äì Bought from the BST, quality is decent but material isn't super stretchy, print is clean but not quite on par with retail

[**Palm Ang3ls Freedom Black Holographic Graphic Tee**](https://imgur.com/a/0G3Etpx) **|  $16 shipped**

* Size M
* Low-tier rep ‚Äì Material is okay, print felt a little too sticker-y to me rather than true print, but it looks cool at least!

[**0ff Wh!te Mona Lisa ""Temperature"" White Graphic Tee**](https://imgur.com/a/08Lckhz)  **|  $22 shipped**

* Size XS (fits oversized, like M)
* Low-tier rep ‚Äì Material is actually pretty nice, print is just a little plasticky, but never had an issue wearing it. An older rep but definitely an eye catcher!

[**0ff Wh!t3 ""Blue Collar"" Black Leather Jacket**](https://imgur.com/a/tAYOp19) | $42 shipped

* Size M
* Mid-tier rep ‚Äì This was a pretty expensive batch from years ago which I purchased from the BST for I believe $60, but the leather quality just wasn't up to par for me. There are some minor tears here and there because of it, but it still looks awesome and frankly kind of seems like it's meant to have a distressed look!

[**Ant! Soc!al Soc!al Club Baby Blue Hoodie**](https://imgur.com/a/FB3kUrK)  **|  $30 shipped**

* Size M/L
* Mid-tier rep ‚Äì Material is pretty heavy but feels a little thin, not quite on par with retail but it's definitely one of the most comfortable hoodies I've ever owned. Have worn only once or twice and haven't worn in forever so someone take it off my hands!

[**Palm Ang3ls ""Sensitive Content"" Oversized Shirt**](https://imgur.com/a/jZasrDA) **| $36 shipped**

* Believe it's tagged M but fits more like L/XL
* Medium/high tier rep ‚Äì Quality is pretty solid and print is crisp and clean

[**Gucc! ""Common Sense is Not That Common"" Sweater**](https://imgur.com/a/g9sQJ0m) **| $24 shipped**

* Size M
* Low-tier rep ‚Äì I used it to layer though so I never had issues!

[**Chr0m3 H3arts ""F\*CK YOU"" Sweater**](https://imgur.com/a/f7vQwqt) **| $29 shipped**

* Size XS/S
* Mid-tier rep ‚Äì Absolutely love this, but it was just a little too tight in the arms for me

[**Chr0m3 H3arts Blue Flannel**](https://imgur.com/a/AhxwOpL) **| $24 shipped**

* Size XS/S
* Low-tier rep ‚Äì Material quality is pretty thin, but buttons and pattern are awesome, so I only ever get compliments on this with 0 issue

[**Bal3nc!aga Black Wax Jeans (as made famous by Kanye)**](https://imgur.com/a/PUu8Fti) **| $68 shipped**

* Size: 30x32
* High-tier rep ‚Äì Paid a pretty penny for these but they just didn't fit me which sucked because the quality is awesome. Someone else could definitely rock them super well!

[**St0n3 !sland Blue Sweatshirt**](https://imgur.com/a/u4xcmSY) **| $32 shipped**

* Size M
* Mid/high-tier rep ‚Äì Such a nice sweatshirt and arm patch is solid, awesome as a casual throw on fit

[**V3rsac3 Black Tiger Floral Sweater**](https://imgur.com/a/MUEkOIs) **| $18 shipped**

* Size M/L
* Low-tier rep ‚Äì Material is nice and soft but the text is off, use it as a layering piece!

[**New York Yankees MLB Fleece Sweatshirt**](https://imgur.com/a/oqCiTg8) **| $26 shipped**

* Size S
* Mid-tier rep ‚Äì Nice and thick and actually super warm but just didn't like the fit on me, isn't super elastic too which is a preference thing but it looks great!

[**(RETAIL) Cotton On Big Cities Black/Grey Hoodie**](https://imgur.com/a/3aOusAk)  **|  $20 shipped**

* Size L (fits like S)
* One of my favorite hoodies for layering and styling with sneakers but I never wear it these days so it's gotta go. Well loved but definitely has some life in it so someone take it from me!

[**(RETAIL) Adidas Red Silky Sweatshirt**](https://imgur.com/a/1TQ6COu) **|. $22 shipped**

* Size S Women's
* My girl bought it new but it didn't fit so selling for her. Really pretty in person! Retails for $55 so snag for a steal!

[**(RETAIL) Civil Regime Maroon/Black Bandana Shirt**](https://imgur.com/a/D0CUUFy)  **|  $14 shipped**

* Size S
* If you're not familiar with Civil Regime, they make some really cool streetwear and dope hoodies/tees. This shirt always gets compliments but I never wear it these days. Someone take it off of me!

[**(RETAIL) Timo/Urban Outfitters Pine Green Sweater**](https://imgur.com/a/h1sejHR) **| $16 shipped**

* Size M (fits like L)
* This is one of my absolute favorite sweaters but I never wear it anymore. Unreasonably comfy. Snag it for the low as a layering piece!

[**(RETAIL) AllSaints Black Zoe Jeans**](https://imgur.com/a/KGfEhxl) **| $25 shipped**

* Size 29 Women's
* Another item from my girl's closet. Classic AllSaints quality so IYKYK. Worn twice and never again, so snag it for the low!

# ACCESSORIES

[**L0u!s Vu!tt0n Blue Tapestry Trunk Bag**](https://imgur.com/a/UczrRya)  **|  $160 shipped**

* LOVE this, one of my absolute favorite reps ‚Äì pattern is not spot on with retail and strap could be a little better quality but other than that, it's a really beautiful bag! Just don't wear it enough to justify keeping it
* Small scratch on one of the metal corners (in photos)
* Comes with LV envelope
* Bought from one of the RepLadies sellers years back for $200

* Length: 19 cm (slightly adjustable)
* Worn only once and never again so needs to go! Super fun piece

[**V!v!enn3 W3stwood Gunmetal Knuckleduster Ring**](https://imgur.com/a/AMylAAO)  **|  $18 shipped**

* Honestly a cool rep and quality is solid, but just didn't fit me right
* Selling because I couldn't quite get it to fit me right ‚Äì I'm a size 7 normally and it was too tight to fit past my knuckle so this would fit a size 6 AKA probably best worn as a pinky ring or if you have slim fingers

# SHOES

[**Prvda Cloudbust Trainers**](https://imgur.com/a/xVkRD1l) **| $70 shipped**

* Size 41 EU
* This is one of the best rep designer shoes I've ever purchased in terms of quality, but they just don't look great on me unfortunately. Should be re-homed ASAP because they'd look fantastic on the right person!

[**""University Blue"" Dunk Lows (Yellow)**](https://imgur.com/a/SYP4IXw)  **|  $50 shipped**

* Size 7.5M / 9W
* Lightly used, no box
* Condition: 8/10 - Missing Nike logo on right insole (Can clean bottoms before shipping if desired!)

[**RETAIL Joe Freshgoods x New Balance 2002R**](https://imgur.com/a/ntO5Obf)  **|  $140 shipped**

Tagged photos with timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/72TZhl9

NB Pr0t3ct1on Pack rain cl0ud Size 8.5 - $80 SOLD

These are great quality. I‚Äôve worn them maybe 4-5 times lightly. So trendy and everyone always complimented me on these. Selling because I have far too much new balances now. 

S4c4i x Fr4gm3nt size 8.5 - $80 

Great pair, high quality. Wore these maybe 2-3 times, but very very lightly. They look great as well, one of my favorite pairs that I really contemplated selling. Selling as I‚Äôm trying to size down my shoe collection.

Hum4nmad3 hoodie size L - $45 PENDING

GREAT quality hoodie. Definitely the highest quality hoodie I‚Äôve ever owned. Very heavyweight hoodie, I think this was close to 1000g. This hoodie was definitely built to last, as the cotton is such high quality. The inside lining is very very soft as well. Selling because I also have far too many hoodies now. 

Ch1nat0wn Mark3t t shirt size L - $25 SOLD

Great t-shirt. Thick cotton, definitely a quality piece. Never got around to wearing it. Great for the summer as the graphics are very nice.

Initi4l D size XL - $20 PENDING

Heavy weight t-shirt, great quality. Was my favorite shirt for such a long time, but lost a lot of weight so it doesn‚Äôt fit me anymore. Great to lounge around in because it‚Äôs so comfy.",8,17,2023-04-18 20:57:21,FashionRepsBST

**UNI\*N AJ4 GUAVA ICE - SIZE 11 - $old**

This is PK batch bought directly from PK. I wore these 3 times to class but that's all. Just a beautiful and clean shoe that received compliments every time I wore it. fr though this is such a unique shoe. Selling this pair since I have 3 of the collab and I'm looking to cut down space before I move!

**NEW BAL\*NCE P550 GREY - SIZE 11 - $OLD**

Clean ass collab and colour. Selling these since I own the green ones as well. Just a sick shoe that goes with every single outfit. I never thought wearing new balances would give me more compliments than Jordans but here we are lol. I wore these a bit but you can judge the condition based on the pictures provided!

**GOLF W@NG 3D TEE - SIZE M - $old**

Dope tee shirt for someone who is into comfy blanks with a cool logo, or, the perfect tee for a Tyler the Creator fan.

**GU\*SS P+F REFLECTIVE TEE - SIZE M - $old*

Never worn, only washed. From UnionKingdom so these are the best batch of the shirts. These shirts had so much hype to them and UK delivered with the quality. Feels like a soft towel and the reflective on the stripes is just BEAUTIFUL in photos. I own the red one so I never wore this one which is why I decided to list it up.

**ST0NE ISL@ND TEE - SIZE XL (UK SIZING SO FITS LIKE M/L US) - $25** 

Straight from TopSt0ney who is the best seller of this brand's reps. Never worn only washed when it came in. Just a clean, high quality shirt that is very very close to retail (as are most tee's from this seller)!

**K\*TH SPACE JAM VINTAGE TEE - SIZE L - $OLD**

As popularized by that one video with LeBron shooting wearing this shirt. Has a nice vintage look to it which makes it look super nice. 

**RETAIL PACSUN TEE - SIZE L - $old**

Literally brand new, straight from Pacsun. Got it as a gift from a friend but I already have enough Pacsun haha. Clean shirt that goes with everything, can't go wrong.",0,5,2022-12-18 15:34:21,FashionRepsBST

Reps- 12

A1r J0rdan 1 P@nda / Black White Bae Size 6Y / Euro 38.5/ Women's Size 7.5, ~~$45 shipped (SOLD)~~

Bought from another user on this sub. However they didn't mention that the right shoe is cut uneven, and the right area around the ankle collar is a CM shorter then the other collar areas. Most people wear pants with over their shoes now a days, so it's an easy flaw to cover. It's also a little hard to see unless your staring at it. Just trying to get back some of what I payed. Quality is a point and a half over a Panda dunk I'd say. No box included.

N1ke A1r More Uptemp0, Size 10, $45 Shipped

A rare rep, and a pretty unique shoe. I accidently pulled too hard on the pull tab on the left shoe and one side came out. You could probably get your local cobbler to sew it back, or even just glue it back. Longer pants could easily cover it as well. Comfort wise it's pretty solid and I had no problem taking shifts in them when I worked retail. No box included.

F0G Scared of G0D Raid in the Friends & Family colorway, Size 9.5 $90 Shipped.

Another rare rep of the F0G Raids in the exclusive friends and family colorway. Only officially released once through the site I believe. Comes with extra white laces as well. I love these but I have too many black/grey shoes haha. Fits TTS. Can go lower on the price if bought without the box.

Reposting since my last post with lower prices this time.

Haven't been into sneakers or reps for that matter for a while now. None of these pairs have been worn since last year so I figured I'd try to move them for some other expenses. Everything has been cleaned and fits an 11.5 (sizing for each specific shoe will be provided below). Prices are negotiable but please be reasonable.

[TAGGED/TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/a/WHJOlkU)

[PICS OF SHOES](https://imgur.com/a/mkdM0VC)

~~-~~ **~~PRESTOS - 85 + shipping~~**

~~Super comfy pair that I wore a lot. Some signs of wear but honestly look great. Size 12 but they fit me as an 11.5 great with a tiny bit of room. A TTS 12 would fit as well. Comes with box and all laces.~~

\- **AJ4 - 95 + shipping**

Worn the most out of every shoe here, as indicated by the bottoms. Still has a ton of life left as the uppers are in fantastic condition. Fits a TTS 12 so an 11.5 will have some wiggle room (I compensated by using an additional insole). Comes with box and all laces.

~~-~~ **~~NEW BALANCE - 75 + shipping~~**

~~Maybe worn 4 times before being put on the shelf. Just couldn't make them work. Lovely pair, the suede is a little dead but one hit with a suede brush and you're good as new. Fits a TTS 11.5, definitely a ""IYKYK"" type of shoe.~~

~~-~~ **~~700V3 - 75 + shipping~~**

~~I think I wore these once to a presentation and once to a Christmas gathering but that's it. Almost as good as new. The glow works great as well, just give it some time in the sun first. Fits an 11.5, a 12 if you prefer a tighter fit.~~

J0rdan 1 Off Wh1t3 UNC size 9: $100 https://imgur.com/a/Ofu7WFs

These are fantastic, writing and midsole look good, ghost stitching and color looks good, extra laces included, no yellowing! No ziptie unfortunately.

J0rdan 4 Pure Money size 9.5: $110 https://imgur.com/a/tMw0EV8

Fits TTS, back tabs are slightly short and skinny Jumpman arm flaw that I can‚Äôt even see from 5 feet away. Overall great quality, just never wore them because they are a bit plain to me.

Nike Dnk L0w Medium Curry size 8: $85 https://imgur.com/a/5Xt9NDr

Fits TTS, I accidentally ordered a size 8 bc I‚Äôm stupid. They look great and great movement on the suede, backtabs and swooshes look spot on imo.

Nike Stssy Spiridon Grey size 8.5: $65 [https://imgur.com/a/OO4SaxJ](https://imgur.com/a/OO4SaxJ)

New Balance 990v2 A1ME LE0N D0RE size 8.5: $55 [https://imgur.com/a/YO9w9ek](https://imgur.com/a/YO9w9ek)

Worn 5ish times. Fits TTS 8.5. I thought I could go half size down in these and I was wrong, they squeeze my toes. Slight glue stains on the back but unnoticeable. Only flaw is that I dropped a marker on these in class and now they have a tiny green stain on the toe box (pain). Comes with extra lace options. Super comfortable like retail. 

G0lf Wang Converse Sail size 8.5: $55 [https://imgur.com/a/yp2hd4X](https://imgur.com/a/yp2hd4X)

&nbsp;

~~**Louis Vuitton Blue/Grey/White Lows from Jelly** - Fits Size 9.5-10 Mens (Insole: 11ish Inches) - HAS REPLACEMENT INSOLES, which I discounted in the overall price. Should be perfect with some Dr. Scholes inserts.Will include the purple/white gradient laces and a free brand new pair of white laces (Bought off the BST and is in used but in great condition. In amazing condition and comes with some customer purple/white gradient laces. Sells from Jelly for around 150 so take for a steal, only selling as I have a black pair I wear all the time. - https://imgur.com/a/I4TY1Rg~~

&nbsp;

~~**New Balance 550 Auralee Cream** - 8.5 Mens (TTS) -  Bought from a fellow user but was too small so I‚Äôm selling to buy in a different size. Amazing quality and the comfort is on par with my retail 550‚Äôs New Balnce x ALD ones down to the insole. It‚Äôs extremely accurate only flaw I know of is the back logo is a bit smaller than retail. -  https://imgur.com/a/w7RDXgq~~

&nbsp;

**Jakob Hetzer 1981 Loafer PlayerShoes Batch** - Fits 8.5 Mens - The design makes it so that it can also fit a Size 8-9 Mens foot as well. This is the best batch out of this shoe at this moment. Extremely high quality IMO and is still in amazing condition despite being worn a few times. Amazing subtle flex and a great looking loafer. -  https://imgur.com/a/wNDhvkm

&nbsp;

#$110 Items:

&nbsp;

**Nike Mummy Dunk Low SB** - 8.5 Mens -  Almost certain this is the updated batch because I know the older batch has big eyes on the back. The glow in the dark on the sole and back leather is pretty nice as well but a little faint. Amazing pair of shoes that always gets looks. -   https://imgur.com/a/ojaFvRa 

&nbsp;

~~**Rick Owens Ramones High-Top Leather** - Size 46 (Size 12 Mens) -  Used but still has a lot of life left in them. Bought for a friend but he flaked. They look amazing and the zippers which are YKK work perfectly.  I can‚Äôt measure insoles but the bottom of the shoe measures approx. 12.25 Inches. - https://imgur.com/a/YV7Sgbp~~

&nbsp;

**Old Navy Camo Drawstring Joggers** - Small (Fits Waist Size 28-31) -  Only reason why this has been in my collection for so long is because they fit sooo well.

~~**Stone Island Black Topstoney Shorts** - Small (Fits Waist Size 28-31, Length: 16 Inches) - Amazing quality shorts. Discounted as they don‚Äôt have a Topstoney badge despite the shorts being from Topstoney but I figure a replacement would be like 5 bucks so I discounted accordingly. - https://imgur.com/a/u2zLesD~~

&nbsp;

**Korean Blue Faded Jeans with Blowouts with Back Zippers** - Small (Fits Waist Size 28-31) - Replicates a style made from Fear of God I think? Back zippers are really hard to zip but they look like a perfect straight pair of denim. All the hardware on the waist looks perfect and this is a great pair of jeans. - https://imgur.com/a/55sYBpg 

&nbsp;

~~**Stone Island Cream Center Logo Tee** - Medium  - Amazing quality tee. Embroidery on the front is extremely clean and the blank is nice and thick. Has super feint stain near the logo but I discounted accordingly and it should come out with a wash. Selling as is. - https://imgur.com/a/W6lOtVc~~

&nbsp;

#$40 Items:

&nbsp;

~~**Kith x Versace Box Logo Tee Black/Gold** - Medium  - Was part of my personal collection but never really wore. Retail goes for a crazy amount like 400 bucks while this rep is pretty much the exact same down to the tags although the blank is a little lighter. Higher priced as I know it‚Äôs a pretty rare rep and I‚Äôm down to keep it in my closet if it doesn‚Äôt sell. - https://imgur.com/a/aJVHz3q~~

&nbsp;

~~**Retail Yeezy Calabasas Joggers (Brown) Sweatpants** - Small - Amazing quality sweatpants. Looks amazing with any Adidas shoe IMO from the Yeezy line to ultra boosts. Extremely comfortable material and perfect for lounging. - https://imgur.com/a/ytnMriw~~

**Gucci Snake Silver Ring SurvivalSource** - 21mm - Amazing quality ring. Has a great weight to it and is in brand new condition. I would 100% be keeping but it only fits my index finger and thumb (I have small fingers). My loss is your gain. - https://imgur.com/a/5bXXaqg

~~**Retail Guess x A$AP Cream Crewneck** - Medium - Yes, this is indeed retail. Only way to tell is that Retail has the inner washtags on the inner side of the crewneck.

1. Item : Represent Owners Club Hoodie Cobalt Blue
- Batch : AngelKing
- Size : XL
- Measurements : Chest - 62cm, Length - 70cm
- only tried on
- Price : sold

2. Item : Represent Owners Club Hoodie Vintage Green
- Batch : AngelKing
- Size : L
- Measurements : Chest - 62cm, Length - 67cm
- only tried on
- Price : sold

3. Item : Bound2 Double Layered Red Stitch Hoodie
- Batch : Bound2
- Size : XL
- Measurements : Chest - 62cm, Length - 68cm
- wore it a few times but still in very good Condition. I don't like the red stitch, wanna sell it and get the non-red stitch one. No I don't want to trade. 
- This Hoodie is heavy as fuck, it weighs almost 2KGs. The weight exceeds DHLs weight limit, which means Shipping for this item would cost 5.99‚Ç¨ for my German bros, and 15.99‚Ç¨ for other EU people.
- Price : sold

4. Item : Yeezy Season 6 Hoodie Core

5. Item : Travis Scott Jackboys E30 Hoodie

- Price : 30‚Ç¨

6. Item : Boneless Varsity Jacket Green
- Batch : Boneless
- Size : XL
- Measurements : Chest - 67cm, Length - 68cm
- This Jacket is very nice and high quality. I compared it to my 300‚Ç¨ Represent Varsity Jacket and the quality is identical. The Materials are all soft and feel nice to the Touch. The inside Tags are made out of some special type of paper which feels expensive. The embroidery is also very clean and nicely stitched. The sleeves are leather. It fits boxy, which is perfect for that 90's/Y2K Style.
- Price : 100‚Ç¨

7. Item : Aime Leon Dore New Balance 550 Green
- Batch : XWCL
- Size : 44
- Wore these a few times, but still in good Condition. They are very comfortable and is better than other batches that are available. For some reason, the midsole looks more yellow, that's because of my crappy camera. It's a nice and light sail color. No box. Fit TTS. 
- Price : 85‚Ç¨

8. Item : Aime Leon Dore New Balance 550 Grey

FAQs:

Q: Do you ship to the US?

A: I do! Shipping is also rather affordable as well, so feel free to DM me for prices!

&#x200B;

Q: How long before you ship?

A: For orders placed by Sunday morning, I will place a courier pickup request for the next working day. For orders after Sunday afternoon, I will do my best to ship out ASAP but no guarantees.

&#x200B;

Q: Why are your prices set as such?

A: I love a good bargain as much as you do, so I try to sell my stuff at low prices for fellow repfam to enjoy! However I am not running a charity, I sell my stuff below cost price + shipping, then I remove value according to the item's condition.

&#x200B;

Q: What currency are your items listed as?

A: Listed in USD, will provide conversion to SGD if requested!

&#x200B;

Q: Will the item fit me?

&#x200B;

Q: What are the flaws on the stuff you sell?

A: Any flaws I'm aware of will be stated, if you ask me for the flaws and it isn't stated I'm just as clueless as you; I post multiple pics for you to do your own judgement.",1,23,2022-01-17 14:57:37,FashionRepsBST

Just a small closet clean-out as I don't really see myself wearing these garments anymore. Mainly because I've lost hella weight and they don't fit me the same nor the way I want them to fit anymore. Most of these pieces were purchased from this sub, some I know the batches, some I don't. I will try my best to give my honest opinion to you guys.

&#x200B;

PAYPAL INVOICE ONLY. SHIPPING IS INCLUDED IN THE PRICE. WILL SHIP VIA USPS PRIORITY MAIL.

[FEAR OF GOD 6TH COLLECTION BAGGY NYLON TROUSER SIZE XL:](https://imgur.com/a/3uIoZMB) Sick and quality piece of rep right here. Nice material, it has a nice baggy fit to it almost like retails. Can fit anywhere from waist size 34 to 38 as it has a denim waist string that can adjust the waist. I'm currently wearing 33 in waist and these fit me anyway, but they too lose for my comfort. They also have a velvet-like pocket which is a nice touch. Purchased them from this sub, worn them once, and decided they were too big. **$70 shipped.**

[~~FOG 3M ESSENTIAL SWEATPANTS SIZE L:~~](https://imgur.com/a/qWfMZS7) ~~The material is exactly like retail as I collect essential pieces here and there. Missed out on this particular drop that's why I copped this rep. Recently got the core collection and decided I don't need two sweatpants that are basically the same. The font is good, 3M is there, french terry material. Fit TTS. I was a size 36 in the waist by the time I copped this and they fit me fine as they have an elastic waistband, also adjustable due to the drawstring. SOLD~~

[STONE ISLAND SMALL LOGO TEE, TAGGED 2XL, FIT SLIM XL](https://imgur.com/a/Pw9MQmD):. One of my impulses buy,  I don't really see me wearing this. Brand new never worn. From Topstoney, the material is just like retail, and fits slim XL or even slightly oversize L. **$45 shipped**

[FEAR OF GOD X NIKE THE QUESTION SIZE 12:](https://imgur.com/a/noDtz5X) Got these pair from this sub, unknown batch. Worn them out couple times, judge the condition by the pictures. I think they have some typical batch flaws with the collar and the bubble not being icy blue. Tried to fix it myself with one of the tutorials from /r/repsneakers. Not a really handy guy and definitely not good at these types of shits lol. After a few wear the bubble has faded back to black again on one shoe for some reason. Hella comfortable nevertheless, probably one of the comfiest kicks I own. Fit TTS. I do not have the box from prior owner, nor the tote bag but I do have the original lace locks and other laces. Take these off my hand for **$95 shipped.**

[~~NEW BALANCE 2002R PROTECTION PACK RAINCLOUD SIZE 12:~~](https://imgur.com/a/YvfWAX3) ~~From Tzesneaker, fit TTS. Not really feeling them in hand and how they look on my feet. I'm no QC expert so you would have to do QC for yourself. Brand new never worn and I do not have the box. Apparently, Tze doesn't ship out this pair with box anymore, at least that's what he told me lol. Brand new never worn, come with one green laces. Just wanted most of my money back.~~ **~~SOLDd~~**",3,7,2022-01-06 17:38:23,FashionRepsBST

new balance,"[FS][UK] Massive clearout! Lots of New Balance (Aime Leon Dore, Tokyo Design Studio, Salehe Bembury, etc), Jordans, Dunks, Size UK 10 and UK 6 - Plus We11Done Flannel Jacket","UK shipping and payment via PayPal invoice only. **Tracked second-class Royal Mail shipping is already included in the price** unless you're buying multiple items, then it'll be an extra ¬£3 and assuming you're in the UK. Would consider posting to the wider EU or even the US but you'd have to cover shipping, which can be pretty costly and/or take forever.

No boxes for the shoes except where noted otherwise. My prices are pretty fair, so please don't try to lowball and don't message if you're not serious about buying. I don't hold items and I will sell to the first payment to actually follow through with the invoice.

Timestamped and tagged pictures [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/VunuDfX) and [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/ymwMLRH)

**We11done Fleece Lined Half-Zip Coat - Size XL (see measurements), brand new with tags - ¬£40**

Shoulder 52 Chest 68.5 Length 77 - Really gorgeous, heavyweight half-zip coat that's lined inside. Made with Highland Tweeds and just really high quality. Bought from Meena, only selling as it's slightly too big. 

**Jordan 1 High Bubble Gum - Size UK 10 - ¬£50**

Only worn once so in perfect condition. Really good quality, super comfortable, only selling as I'm out of shelf space and trying to be super choosy about what I keep and I have rarely gone to these since getting. Bought from Panda.

**Jordan 3 Rust Pink - Size UK 10 - ¬£25**

Company-level batch, but can't remember who I bought them from. Worn a few times and super comfortable, just never go to them anymore.

**New Balance x Tokyo Design Studio RC1300 - Size UK 10, brand new with tags - ¬£25 - SOLD SOLD SOLD**

Great trainers, super comfortable when I tried on, just literally bought about 9 pairs of trainers that looked the same and my other half told me off, haha.

**New Balance 992 x WTAPS - Size UK 10, brand new with tags - ¬£30 - SOLD SOLD SOLD**

Feel great quality, super comfortable, but I have the JJJounds and wear those all the time, so again, trying to be brutal here. 

**New Balance 550 x Aime Leon Dore in grey - Size UK 6.5, brand new with tags and extra laces - ¬£35 - SOLD SOLD SOLD**

Other half really liked them in all the pictures even though she didn't think they were ""her"" but wanted them anyway. They came, and she decided they're definitely not her, hence sale. 

**Nike VaporWaffle x Sacai in Sesame - Size UK 10 - ¬£35 - SOLD SOLD SOLD**

Great quality, super comfortable, just never get worn. Pretty sure I bought these from STOS but don't quote me on that.

**Jordan 4 Aleali May Camo - Size UK 10 - ¬£25**

Really nice quality, bought these from STOS, just have nothing to match them so never wear them. Really went back on forth on selling these because I love them so much but ultimately need the space. 

**New Balance 57/40 x Bricks & Wood Forest Green- Size UK 10 - ¬£30 - SOLD SOLD SOLD**

Worn a couple of times but still in great condition. I'm pretty sure I have the spare laces with these as well so will include in package. 

**New Balance x Salehe Bembury 2002R - Size UK 10 - ¬£30 - SOLD SOLD SOLD**

Bought from Gege Witch, only worn once. 

**Nike SB Dunk Light Bone - Size UK 6.5, brand new - ¬£35 - SOLD SOLD SOLD**

Bought from STOS, again, other half thought she wanted them but has now decided she doesn't because she prefers her JOrdan 1 Paris lows

Q: Why is the item already sold when you stated it was available? (added in to explain to buyers showed discontent)

A: Stuff sells fast on the BST, especially at the prices I sell at. I try and make it as fair as possible, my general rules of engagement are that the item is fair game and I will reply as fast as I can, up until I send someone an invoice. Once invoice is sent I will hold the item for an hour or so, and continue to chat with interested parties but will stop short of sending an invoice (after you send me your paypal). If invoice is not paid for after my deadline is past I will open it to the second fastest person to send their paypal, and so on, to ensure as much equity as possible.

Q: What are the flaws on the stuff you sell?

FAQs:

Q: Do you ship to the US?

A: I do! Shipping is also rather affordable as well, so feel free to DM me for prices!

&#x200B;

Q: How long before you ship?

A: For orders placed by Sunday morning, I will place a courier pickup request for the next working day. For orders after Sunday afternoon, I will do my best to ship out ASAP but no guarantees.

&#x200B;

Q: Why are your prices set as such?

A: I love a good bargain as much as you do, so I try to sell my stuff at low prices for fellow repfam to enjoy! However I am not running a charity, I sell my stuff below cost price + shipping, then I remove value according to the item's condition.

&#x200B;

Q: What currency are your items listed as?

A: Listed in USD, will provide conversion to SGD if requested!

&#x200B;

Q: Will the item fit me?

A: I will do my best to help you with the fit, for reference my stats are 182cm, 70kg, shoe size US9.5-10

&#x200B;

Q: Why is the item already sold when you stated it was available? (added in to explain to buyers showed discontent)

A: Stuff sells fast on the BST, especially at the prices I sell at. I try and make it as fair as possible, my general rules of engagement are that the item is fair game and I will reply as fast as I can, up until I send someone an invoice. Once invoice is sent I will hold the item for an hour or so, and continue to chat with interested parties but will stop short of sending an invoice (after you send me your paypal). If invoice is not paid for after my deadline is past I will open it to the second fastest person to send their paypal, and so on, to ensure as much equity as possible.

Q: What are the flaws on the stuff you sell?

A: Any flaws I'm aware of will be stated, if you ask me for the flaws and it isn't stated I'm just as clueless as you; I post multiple pics for you to do your own judgement.",2,6,2021-11-05 22:28:20,FashionRepsBST

1985 Nike Sky Force High size 9.5, sharing similarities with Nike basketball shoes at that time, this is one of the best condition pairs of these that I‚Äôve been able to find. The shoes previously were converted into roller skates, so there are holes drilled into the soles.

Timestamps: https://imgur.com/a/V1CTcg8

My style has changed and I'm looking to move some of the stuff I no longer wear. No boxes, I think I have the dustbags for the Triple S' somewhere though. 

Balenciaga Triple S, Black/White/Red, Size 41, I bought them used in Japan a couple years ago but have maybe worn them 5 times myself. $220 shipped - Cheapest I found was a 42 that looked like it'd seen war for 220 so I think this is fair, but feel free to send me an offer

Yeezy 700 V2 ""Mauve"" - Size 10, also bought in Japan during the same trip. These are a bit more worn but tons of life left, looking for $85 shipped on these. Lowest I could find was $150 + shipping with the box, but the condition was a bit better.  


EDIT: Realized I left the 500's in the Title, sorry they were sold!

I have a bunch of sneakers I don't wear and they just sit in my closet. Some of these I've maybe only worn once and then never again. A lot of impulse purchases. Really want to just get rid of them and make space for sneakers that I actually wear on a daily. Typically I would use USPS 2 day shipping but someone showed me this website called pirateship? Suppose to be better? So that's how I will try to ship. Some of these don't have boxes either. Local deals will be prioritized sorry.

The new ""M992TC"" has a color scheme inspired
by outdoor gear and clothing from the 90s.
The first thing that catches your eye is the bright
turquoise color and purple color combination of
the upper of the ""M992TC""
The usual mesh upper has been changed to
ripstop nylon, and the combination with the
high-quality pigskin suede that is synonymous
with 992 creates a sophisticated design
The new ""M992TC"" is an exclusive model that is
only available at BILLY'S in Japan",6,1,2025-03-22 08:25:21,SneakerMarket

I was recently laid off and have to downsize a ton ahead of moving into a smaller space. This money goes to bills, cats, moving fees, etc. I‚Äôm flexible on prices. Imgur links: https://imgur.com/a/3wh4HuE https://imgur.com/a/I5taK2R and everything else here pictured is fair game, I just haven‚Äôt had the time to catalog and price everything. 

All shoes in the Imgur link are as is, no boxes. If you see anything here you‚Äôre remotely interested in please let me know. I will bundle, I will work on prices, I will kiss you on the lips. I have about 10-12 other pairs currently at my gfs place that I will also be adding when I get the chance. 

It is extremely hard to part with some of these as they‚Äôve been in my collection for ages now. But it is what it is, and I need to focus on getting my life in better order right now. ",0,26,2025-03-06 07:22:02,SneakerMarket

adidas samba,"[WTS] A lot of sneakers, closet clear out good prices 10.5 - 12 [W] Paypal/Local","Hello everyone, 

I have a bunch of sneakers I don't wear and they just sit in my closet. Some of these I've maybe only worn once and then never again. A lot of impulse purchases. Really want to just get rid of them and make space for sneakers that I actually wear on a daily. Typically I would use USPS 2 day shipping but someone showed me this website called pirateship? Suppose to be better? So that's how I will try to ship. Some of these don't have boxes either. Local deals will be prioritized sorry.

The only pair that really has wear on them are the white sambas but I just don't wear them anymore. Black one I wore once, spezials only worn twice? and triest I never got the time to wear them. 

Looking to sell locally for $120. We could try to ship but I'm sure 4 pairs of sneakers in a box might be a hefty shipping fee. Just trying to make space and dont want to have sneakers laying around I don't touch. 

EDIT: idiot me didnt put sizes in the title. Adidas Sambas and Spezial are 11.5. Triest are size 11

Hello everyone, I have more or less my whole entire sneaker collection for sale. I really want to declutter a lot because most of these have just sat in my closet and don't get any where. These are not really my style at all and I like some basic cortezs sambas or reeboks. These sizes vary from 10.5 to 11.5. Some are too tight and some are too big for me. Looking for honest deals. I hope these go to someone who has much better styling than me and can use these to their full potential. I have boxes for some but not all. Thank you so much for looking at them. I'll stay open to offers but I'm pretty tight on what I'm looking since I'm sure these prices are much below what others are looking for. If you are unsure of sizing, I'll do my best to chime in and see if they will fit you or not or HOW they will fit you

yeezy,Advice for my kid (15M) who wants to start reselling,"This is going to be his own venture and he will be pretty independent with it, but we want to be able to help him if he has questions or is at risk of making any big mistakes. We're in the US, and this is all brand new to me. 

He wants to download a 'bot app' on his phone, and use it to get popular shoes (like Yeezy slides this week). He can afford a single bot, but would prefer a double so he doesn't have to pay more every drop. He expects to pay $150 for the single. Is he on the right track?

He'll be in school from 720am-220pm, does someone still need to log on at the time of the drop for this to work? I saw a recent post of someone asking how to connect from work.

The cooks group seems essential to me. He hasn't mentioned joining any but I will ask him about it. To clarify, cooks is mainly a resource and the user is still running their own bots separate from the group?

To me it looks way more involved then download an app, link a card, and get shoes on auto pilot. I did read the mega guide, I can direct him to read it too. Any other general advice or anything more recent we should know?",0,8,2022-08-25 04:42:45,SneakerBots

yeezy,Scam Alert - Hypenovelties,"All
I placed an order with hypenovelties on November 1; (it was a preorder for the Yeezy MX Rocks - which officially dropped on December 22).

The backdrop: I had long followed this company but never placed a single order as I was always reluctant. However, prior to November 1 when I hit the bullet and took a chance, I naively and myopically charged my card for the aforementioned Yeezys. 

Two reasons. First of which, the company originally was dedicated to selling UA‚Äôs and generators such that one could lie and flip the sneakers to others for retail price. I never made a purchase because I found it immoral. But I honestly was impressed by how advanced they were. Figured I‚Äôd learn what I could and educate myself so I wouldn‚Äôt be on the wrong end of buying fake shoes unknowingly‚Ä¶ but then sometime during September/October I got
an e-mail from hype‚Äôs owner, (Jack Bensley), essentially saying they‚Äôve decided to stop the UA‚Äôs and focus solely on selling legitimate,
retail drops (via their inside contacts with footlocker)‚Ä¶
I was at that point intrigued. I started texting Jack (in hindsight, who knows if it was actually him and if that name is real/a pseudonym)‚Ä¶ he was initially super friendly, helpful and informative about the process because I was still skeptical. But I figured worst case scenario, I‚Äôd save all of the texts and e-mails via SS to file a dispute with my bank to get refunded‚Ä¶

I was given assurance that once the sneakers were released, I‚Äôd receive tracking. Once the 22 of December rolled around, though,
I shot a text to him but no reply back. Red flag #1.

I then logged into the site to check my account. Prior to handing over my money, whenever I‚Äôd sent questions through their website, I‚Äôd receive timely responses‚Ä¶ despite the first red flag, I still gave them the benefit of doubt. ‚ÄúMaybe Jack was super busy‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just message the customer service as I did in the past. Red Flag #2. No reply. To this date.

I did get a robotic and pithy text from Jack after over a day. The friendly and helpful guy (who had now secured my payment) was insulting and intentionally vague/unwilling to provide tracking as promised. No reassurance or confirmations or anything to offer a shred of evidence that I wasn‚Äôt just scammed out of over $200.

TDLR: hypenovelties is a fraudulent/scam trap. I should have known better. I realize I should‚Äôve done due diligence and ask others if they were legit. My own fault for being stupid and gullible‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be spending Xmas Eve uploading all the screenshots and dialogue to my bank to recover my funds but I‚Äôm hoping to put hype on public blast while also ensuring others don‚Äôt fall for the same trap as me‚Ä¶

I‚Äôd like to cross-post this for optimal exposure.
If anyone has any advice on where else I could put this PSA out, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

Idk the sub‚Äôs rules but if I‚Äôm allowed to post the screenshots, please do let me know. BEWARE OF HYPENOVELTIES! They‚Äôre scamming and I have no idea how many others have been burned‚Ä¶I hope to do something meaningful with Reddit. The best vengeance would be to put these lying scumbags out of business.

Stay safe, all.

yeezy,How expensive should bots be?,"Hello,

I have developed a Supreme Bot recently and I'm interested in how much you guys think it is worth.

I'll run you through it's functionality.

You fill out a form in my program which locally stores all of your autofill information.

Then, you need to fill in what item you want. So you need to choose a category, keywords, a colour if you want to and a size if you want to. If you want to fill anything in manually (e.g. CVV), you can leave that field blank.

Next, you choose if you want it to click process payment for you or not and you can even disable auto-fill completely.

And you can also enter a proxy if you would like to do that.

Once you have done this, you can then run the bot. This will open up Google Chrome and go to the category page. The bot is now primed for the drop, all you need to do is press refresh the page with F5 until the website updates on release day, and it will add it to cart and go to the checkout page (and autofill/process payment if you chose that option).

The bot typically gets to the final checkout page (before you click process) in about 1.5 seconds. I think this is probably too quick as you are likely to get your payment denied, so I will allow you to set a delay in milliseconds.

Also, it should not get hit by reCaptcha.

So that is the current state of my bot.

However, I believe I can quite easily give the bot the ability to simultaneously open multiple instances of itself, each instance will have its own proxy/info as set by you, and they will auto-refresh on release day.

I can probably make the bot run without you actually seeing anything except my program and a Command Prompt (i.e. a headless browser) if you don't want it opening a bunch of Chrome windows.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to explain everything as well as I could.

So, how much do you guys think this bot is worth in its current state, and how much do you think it would be worth if I could add the multiple instances feature? Also, would any of you be interested in purchasing a bot like this?

Thank you for your time.

TLDR; I made a bot which checks out an item on Supreme on release day with many options e.g. proxies, auto buy, etc. It should be able to get past reCaptcha. I can probably make it run multiple instances simultaneously with different proxies and info and also run as a headless browser. How much do you think this bot would be worth (with and without the multiple instances), and would you be interested in purchasing a bot like this?

UPDATE:

I am currently working on multiple bots. These bots include an adidas splash page bot, a shopify bot (including Yeezy Supply), a restock monitor and of course the Supreme bot. 

My Supreme bot has come a long way, and is now capable of running many simultaneous tasks with multiple profiles. It also includes smart autofill, captcha bypass, adaptive refresh capabilities, ability to checkout in 1 second flat, proxy functionality and much more.

If you would like to make a suggestion please pm me.

2)Is the PID B37572 and do you just use that or the whole early link
3)What are monitor proxies and do I need them
4)Is there a limit to how many HMAC destroyers I should use and what refresh rate should I use for them
5)Should I use 3rd Party Captcha solvers or just do it manually
6)And just to clear it up; are the normal tasks just sitting in the queue as a normal person would, waiting to see if they get though the splash page. And are the HMAC destroyers actively trying to bypass the splash page? So, how should I arrange my 50 proxies? Would it be 25 hmacs, 13 #waithmac and 12 normal?

7)If a hmac destroyer gets through, can you keep adding more threads every time it cops to cop again without sitting on the splash?

I'm trying to learn before the next yeezy launch but i thought id ask an idea I had. 

Would anyone on here be willing to snag a pair of yeezys for me on up coming launch? I can think of two scenarios that we could do:

1) you can cop multiple pairs in your cart and once you succefullu checkout and receive the shoes I can pay you the money for the shoes + shipping to me + whatever money on top you would want for doing all of this. And then you can ship it to me 

2 ) you cop a pair in a cart seperate to yours on a account that we both know username and pass. Ill log in and purchase them myself and ship them to myself. And once done I can pay you for your services. 

Let me know if this would appeal to any of you. Its extra money you would be making for more shoes and proxies/ servers! And if it works out we can do it for future releases!!",3,14,2017-09-11 11:47:29,SneakerBots

yeezy,Few questions about copping multiple Yeezy's,"Hey everyone, I just had a few questions regarding increasing my chances of copping multiple pairs of the Zebra Yeezy's that are rereleasing on the 24th. I currently have AIO around 70 ish proxies, and a server.

My first question is does it matter where my server is located? Or rather, is there any advantage to having a server and proxies based in LA as opposed to Buffalo. Originally I assumed that Buffalo would be better since it's closer to the servers of the 4 copsites; but after talking to several proxy and server providers for a few days, they say that as long as you have a server and proxies that are very close to each other, the distance from your server to the cop site server is irrelevant. Is this true?

Second, If I'm purchasing multiple pairs of Yeezy's on the same site (obviously with a different card/billing address and a different purchase order) can I put the same shipping address for the 2 separate orders but change it slightly, so for example 555 baker ST and 555 baker STREET

Finally, are there any tips that you guys would give that you would think to be crucial when it comes to successfully copping multiple pairs. I've copped in the past, but I'm trying to step it up a bit, so is there anything I should know going into this.

yeezy,extremely frustrated with AIO,"I got the AIO bot before release  and i know that im not guaranteed to cop a pair - but i have missed three drops (zebra , TBUB , and AW) and each drop i spent a majority of my time solving recaptchas and then bam sold out. Its so frustrating because i dropped a bomb on approximately 300-400 proxies a server and the bot itself. What the fuck is going on? I only carted once for TBUB and i couldnt even check out. If fucking pisses me off because im solving captchas for hours and when i go on twitter someone copped 5 pairs - an hour ago.

1) The bot asking me to solve capchas - sure i solve them ( i have anticaptchas too) and when it receives the cap and i understand that some tasks will receive an invalid captcha, thats totally fine because do get captchas wrong. But for the tasks that do receive a valid captcha solution my log is bombarded with errors ( Acess denied, Empty text , item not found ?? WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE?). Anticapcha solved a grand total of 1k captchas and myself around 200 for about 2 hours before i decided to fuck it


2) For today's drop  there was a splash page and a queue so i presume most of my regular tasks were rendered useless due to the splash, would it be advisable to run 90% of my proxies in HMAC with 20 HMAC tasks? WHat do you guys think?

3) I actually tested my proxies after 2 hours of the bot running , and it seems only 2-3 were banned and their latency is <50ms. 

4) My server seems to be fine too, at this point of time it seems cheaper for me to just buy some fucking resale yeezys then to actually cop a pair myself!

yeezy,My fellow Australian bot users please help,"Hi all

I've just discovered this whole world of bots I knew it was happening but didn't know anything about it, been doing a lot of reading and still don't know much.

I'm in Australia and primarily wanting to get a bot or bots to help increase my chances of copping from adidas AU as my main go to for Ultraboosts, NMD and Yeezys. A lot of the other foot sites abroad don't ship to us here in Aus and most of the little independent retailers here do their own online or in store raffles.

So what I'm wanting to know what are the go to bots to look into and do I need to worry about looking into proxies and servers/vpn if I'm only trying to cop a few pairs for me and couple of mates. Not trying to be the next Allen Kuo 

Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks and good luck to you all with the Supreme drop and next weekends Zebras.

yeezy,[Question] When to start bot,Currently I have ANB AIO and this past yeezy release was my first time using a bot and unfortunately failed. Since then I've invested a lot of my time into learning even more about hyped sneaker releases in general but keep stumbling upon one question: When do I start the bot? For at least adidas I know on the website for ANB it says when the splash page is live but I've been told to start when the splash page is live AND the stock is loaded. The stock for the bred yeezys didn't load in until 10:30 am EST but the splash page was up at 10. If anyone could provide any answers as to when you should start ANB it would be greatly beneficial for not only me but maybe other people having the same problem. ,12,0,2017-02-17 16:11:49,SneakerBots

yeezy,Yeezy V2 Setup Forum,"I feel we needed to have a sub where we can bounce ideas off each other so that we can all succeed in getting yeezy's. This can be our chatting area that is strictly on increasing chances. Of course I will contribute and share information that I have picked up. Here goes.

First we need to talk about proxies and servers. Proxies allow you to purchase sneakers through different ip addresses. This avoids the possibility of getting you banned and increases your chances of getting sneakers. So do you need proxies. Absolutly. 

Servers allow you to remotely access a computer in a different location and buy shoes from there. These computers have tremendous internet speed and processing power depending on the package you select. It the botting game every millisecond counts. Servers can help boost your chances but they are not as important as proxies at least in my case. If your computer is slow I highly recommend you get a server.

Moving on to selecting proxies and servers. For the most part you are going to want your proxies and servers in the same area. So if you have proxies in Los Angeles then your server should also be in Los Angeles. Another point to note is that for major footsites such as Footlocker and Champs having proxies and servers in Los Angeles will be the best location.

The proxies I use are from MyPrivateProxy and BlasingSEO. (NOTE: I am not forcing you to take these recommendations seriously. I am just telling you what I use.)  

For my server I use Vultr because they have an hourly charge of like a $1 an hour but I hear shoeservers.com is really good. (NOTE: I am not forcing you to take these recommendations seriously. I am just telling you what I use.)

Choosing the right website is very important. Certain websites may get more traffic than others. Certain websites have better security against bots. Your connection to one website may be faster than your connection to another website. Overall picking a website is definitely a factor. I go for the common footsites because my connection to them is the fastest and I wont get banned because I run one task per proxy. Some people go for shopify sites like bodega but those sites get a lot of traffic and the captcha's they use are different from google captcha. It is risky to put all your cards down on shopify websites unless you understand them. Of course you have typical clothing websites that just so happen to get yeezy's and these are the websites that probably work the best. When I first started botting I used JimmyJazz for the Yeezy V2 Beluga and got 11 added to cart. So what you are looking for is a normal shoe site that sells the Yeezy's. As for the Adidas website sometimes it works out and and sometimes it doesn't

Early links don't necessarily give you a head start but it allows you to have a chance to buy the first wave of shoes. The reason the yeezy's continue to sell 2 hours after the release time is because they are sold in waves/groups. It's not sold all at once. Early links allow you to be in the first wave/group that has an opportunity to purchase the shoes. To find early links you can search them up online.

Backdoors allow you to sneak past splash pages and get right to the add to cart stage. I do not understand backdoors paseed that but I believe backdoors are given to you in the form of a link. If anyone has info on that please share.

Proxies and Servers are the 2 fundamental aspects of increasing your chance with a bot. But I am sure there is more to botting than what I mentioned. If you have ideas, techniques or opinions you would like to share feel free to do so. Specifically I would like to touch on increasing chances, early links and backdoors.",5,33,2016-11-21 19:34:36,SneakerBots

Not gonna lie, I personally think these are ugly‚Ä¶ but tbh, they‚Äôre super comfy, especially after hooping. The full Nike ReactX foam makes them feel great on foot, but do they have that Yeezy Slide hype?

Are these the next go-to slip-on, or will they flop? Should we make them or skip them? Let us know what you think!

yeezy,First Rep Yeezy 350 Turtle Dove from Kickwho,"Hey I just got my First replica Sneaker, i bought these Turtle Doves from Kickwho for 150$ including shipping.

Im not exactly an expert but i think theyre really good, the only thing i can spot is that you can see some glue between sole and upper, on my ""real"" yeezys i never saw glue but i dont know how normal that is with replicas, but its not so bad because you can only spot it when you look at them really close i dont think you would be ably to spot them on feet. Also there are 4 Blue dots on the pull tab, kinda looks like made with an ink pen, you can see 2 of these dots on picture 3. All in all i would rate them 8/10 because of these minor flaws but im really happy because these are my favourite yeezys.

yeezy,[Collection Review] Zoom Alphafly 3 Next% from Lucus,"üó£Ô∏èIntro:

Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen to a new Review. Today I have Nike Zoom Alphafly 3 Next% here for you. 

üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èDescription

The Nike Zoom Alphafly 3 Next% is a cutting-edge running shoe designed for elite performance. It features a highly responsive ZoomX foam midsole combined with dual Air Zoom pods in the forefoot for unparalleled energy return. The lightweight, breathable upper ensures a snug, adaptive fit, while the carbon fiber Flyplate provides propulsion with each stride. The outsole is engineered with strategically placed traction patterns for grip on various surfaces. A refined heel design enhances stability, making it ideal for long-distance racing. Sleek and innovative, the Alphafly 3 Next% pushes the limits of speed and comfort.

üë®üèª‚Äçüè´Review and final Conclusion üë®üèª‚Äçüè´

I really was interested to trying these out. Now I have them in Hands and try to describe them the best as I can. Let‚Äôs start with the uppers. The upper and tongues are seemed together as one piece. Some of you prefer a tongue as an extra piece. I can understand that. Upper Materials are very stretchy and will give‚Äôs you a socky feel on feet. Breathability is top notch. You can see how the orange colored insoles are shining thru the uppers. You can feel the air venting between your toes while walking around. There is only some padded areas at the heel insides. That‚Äôs it but they‚Äôre still comfortable. Optical wise they do looking pretty good. The oversized Swooshes goes over the Midsoles like they should. Stitching jobs are well done. No excessively glue stains or something like that which is good. Now on to the most interesting part, The Midsoles. Well, I doubt the Foam is near as the real ZoomX foam. I‚Äôve watched a couple of videos online and compared them. I‚Äôm pretty sure the foam at retails is way more bouncy and responsive compared to the Rep Pair. To be fair the foam from my pair isn‚Äôt bad as it sounds first. It‚Äôs still very spongy and bouncy, and feels very comfortable on feet. At first try on feet they‚Äôre feeling very weird, but in an interesting good way. You can feel the bouncy foam thru the whole feet while walking around. In the forefoot Area‚Äôs you can feel the Zoom Air pockets. The Zoom Air works here really good. At that point I was surprised. They‚Äôre very bouncy and responsive, you can feel them working with every step clearly. Sadly there is no carbon plate between the uppers and the Midsoles. It‚Äôs a medium hard plastic plate. It works, but I have no retail pair here to can make a proper comparison at that point. Outsoles are looking good to me. There isn‚Äôt much rubber like in other running shoes. I guess it‚Äôs to increase the weight. I weighed the shoes. One Shoe in Size EU41 weights 280 grams. I went in my normal size with these and they‚Äôre fitting me a half size too big. Next time I‚Äôd size down a half size for a better and tighter fitment. The big question is, would I run in them. I think so yeah, but not long distances like 5km and up. Are they‚Äôre worth to getting them ? If you want a funny and comfy feeling shoe you can go for them. I mean they‚Äôre 85$ shipped and for that price they‚Äôre good.

yeezy,THE REAL DEAL,"I got the Yeezy boost 350 V2 cinder non reflective  from PK Kim at Perfect Kicks. 

I was just absolutely stunned! I couldn‚Äôt believe how great these shoes came out. First of all it was my first time buying reps as I‚Äôm new to the game. However I couldn‚Äôt believe the craftsmanship as well as the communication. Super simple to order, just went on the website, saw the shoes I liked, messaged PK Kim on WhatsApp and that was it. 

For the most part there is a large variety of shoes to choose from.

I waited about 1-2 weeks for the shoes to arrive (Wasn‚Äôt in a rush to receive them). Overall was extremely impressed and wanted to make this review as I know there is a lot of scammers and I can affirm you, this isn‚Äôt one. I will most definitely be returning back for multiple pairs.

yeezy,Yeezy 350 V2 Zebra from JK Fung ($95 shipped),"Overall 9.5/10 only small flaw is little thread coming off of the front of the sole. 

This is a PK batch, everything that I can tell is perfect, boost is just as comfortable or and almost softer than retail boost. Size is TTS I got a 10.5 and they fit perfect. These have the correct zebra pattern and the stitching is correct as well. 

Only thing to note is ask for double box, mine came slightly damaged if you care about that

yeezy,"[Review] Nike Air Jordan 4 x TS ""Friends & Family""","[cover photo](https://i.imgur.com/L1Q63At.jpg)

**Introduction**

What‚Äôs good Repfam?! It's your guy back at it again with another review and this time it's for a Nike Air Jordan 4 from the Friends and Family collection with none other than Travis Scott. Let's jump right in!

Unreleased to the public, the Nike Air Jordan 4 Retro Travis Scott ‚ÄòPurple Suede‚Äô was first seen on DJ Chase B‚Äôs feet during Travis Scott‚Äôs launch of the Air Jordan 4 ‚ÄòHouston Oilers‚Äô sneakers. The elusive purple sneaker would worn by Scott throughout 2018, peaking the interest of collectors everywhere. The sneaker would eventually be released as a friends and family drop in 2019.¬†

The Air Jordan 4, one of the most popular models of Air Jordans, was created by famed Nike designer Tinker Hatfield. It was the second Air Jordan model that Tinker designed and the second one to feature visible Air. The Air Jordan IV originally came out in 1989 with 4 colors: white and cement grey, white black and red, off-white and military blue, and black and red (Bred). Because of its popularity the Air Jordan 4 has seen many innovative collaborations throughout its history.¬†

This pair features a soft purple suede upper with black grid mesh, matte ‚Äòwaffle‚Äô eyelets and a translucent grey sole. The heel features the iconic Cactus Jack logo on the right heel and the classic Nike Air logo on the left. It is suggested that this rare pair was made exclusively for Travis Scott‚Äôs friends and family.

**Timelines**¬†¬†

Jan 29 - ordered and paid¬†¬†

Jan 31 - QC pictures received, GL'ed¬†¬†

Feb 2 - tracking received¬†¬†

Feb  7 - arrived in Fedex Memphis Hub

Feb 8 - parcel delivered  ¬†¬†

[Glam photos](https://imgur.com/a/QTZXVZs)

**Pros**

* Excellent suede material all around
* Overall shape is the usual Jordan 4
* Toe boxes are perfectly tapered and aren‚Äôt too boxy
* Lace stays have good size and proper placement
* Very good netting akin to retail Jordan 4s
* Triangle lace holder is in proper placement
* Amazingly clear air bubble
* Stitching is good all around
* Even heel tabs and tall tongues
* Cactus Jack logo and Nike Air placement superb
* Inverted text on the inside of the tongue accurate
* Insoles having TS text very decent
* excellent midsole paint job
* perfect outsole execution without messy overlapping paint and/or rubber

**Cons**

* can't really see any flaw with this pair as I don't obviously have a retail to compare

**Verdict**¬†¬†

There you have it! A properly executed copy of the elusive and very expensive Friends and Family Jordan 4 of Travis Scott from Sneakerwill. Retail pairs have been sold for 30K and above so this tells no mere mortal usually rock this pair. Then again, we here at repsneakers obtain these for collection among others but no one's stopping any repfam from rocking this out and about! Keep that confidence at 100% and i'll see you all on the next one. Cheers!

asics,[DETAILED REVIEW] Asics Gel-Kahana TR-V4 from Lara üî•,"**‚úçÔ∏è Brief Description:**

Elevate your off-road adventures with the ASICS Gel-Kahana TR V4 Silver White 1203A497-200. Engineered with a breathable mesh upper, these durable shoes provide optimal airflow and comfort. The GEL cushioning system absorbs impact, while the rugged outsole ensures traction on any terrain. Experience superior performance and style with the Gel-Kahana TR V4, perfect for hiking, trail running, and urban exploration

‚û°Ô∏è **Full detailed review:**

* Overall shape looks accurate
* Toebox looks nice to me and not too thick
* Mesh upper material seems fine to me
* The details around the shoe seems pretty accurate to me
* Tongue Asics logo looks good, there is nothing much to say
* The GEL cushioning system make those sneaker very comfortable
* Heels shaoe looks good together with logos
* Sole is firm and steady in place

üöπ **Customer service experience:**

The whole conversation was smooth and every question I asked met my needs. They use high quality and most reliable shipping services like Fedex, DHL, Aramex, Royal Mail etc. After your package is shipped, they will provide you a tracking code within few days where you can track your package.

QC photos are of high quality, taken from all angles (360 degress) where you can inspect the condition from every angle and quickly decide whether it is GL or RL. If you are not satisfied with QC photos, my suggestion is to always for more pictures or daylight condition photos.

They have no problem listening to advice or even if you RL a pair, they are willing to change to a new pair until they finally reach your satisfaction. If there is any problems with the seller, you can contact me privately. Good luck!

Ive come across this seller who goes by the company name ygfashion. Their catalogs have a wide variety of items but im not sure if I can trust them to ship the items as they only accept payment methods which cannot be disputed.

Other suspicions arose from the seller having every item in stock, by that i mean vintage nike airmax, asics kinsei etc. They haven't once said no stock to an item Ive requested for as they have even the most niche items. (image attached for reference).

**Middleman**: **Bruce** is always my go to, I've only purchased through him 5+ times over the last few years, and I'm always happy with his prompt replies, quick QCs, and how quickly he ships. Cost 1000 CNY, (I think between 150-160 USD at the time). Some people may say it's a little more expensive than others, but to me how awesome he is - is worth the extra few bucks.

**3 rounds of QC** till I found one I wanted. I think for me the ""AIR"" placement was the big factor for me. Wanted as close as possible. Here they are: [first](https://imgur.com/a/rMV3bZT) [second](https://imgur.com/a/tZOzql4) [third](https://imgur.com/a/pYm46zu)

Comfort -- now I've never had a pair of 4s personally, but these are ridiculous - SUPER Comfortable.

Sizing- asked for 10.5 Mens (12 w) fit perfectly! (TTS, everything I own is 10.5 (UBs, AM90s, Asics retails)

Look, I'm not an expert so you can make your own determination, also these are relatively rare imo I've never seen anyone with these on in the streets although it is a pandemic. To me these look pretty spot on, it does have a peachy-hue to it if you can't tell in the pictures. Very happy with them (which is the most important factor)!

asics,"We're all out to FLEX and if you say you're not, you're in denial!","A while ago in some thread I can't recall, I remember reading a user's comment and the gist was that we buy replicas to flex and that claiming we enjoy the design of a hyped pair is just denial and that we are all out to flex no matter what way you spin it.

But guess what, that's JUST YOUR OPINION!! ... O\_\_\_O ... Everyone has different thoughts as well as reasons and motivations for buying reps. Don't project yourself onto others and remember, never assume because that makes an **ASS** out of **U** and **ME**.

From my experience, I remember that I liked the aesthetic and concept behind the OW designs when seeing them for the first time. I knew enough to recognize the Nike models but I didn't know who Virgil and what Off-White was and honestly just not that knowledgeable on street wear. I just remember seeing them as Nike models with a cool artistic ""twist"" and wanted them. After a bit more research I learned about the whole Off-White brand and the Nike collab and all the hype around it. I ended up buying reps of the OW Chicago's and it's hard to separate the hype from the sneaker and I won't deny perhaps it did partially motivate my purchase, but I initially did just actually like the design itself. But let's revisit that user's comment about flexing. It just rubbed me the wrong way because I never bought them to flex or to wear them as a display of money or wealth. I mean that's mainly why I DON'T wear them as often as I'd like to. I'm not afraid of being called out, rather I dislike that people will perceive that I'm wearing them to flex. 

This is the same reason why I don't buy ANY high end fashion brands like Balenciaga, Dior, Gucci, etc. Not bashing anyone that buys high end reps it's just not for me. Again, that's my opinion and my own feeling. I just want to re-emphasize to those here that think otherwise, we're not all hypebeasts and looking to flex on everyone. I mean I just dropped over $300 for a pair of the END. x Asics Gel Lyte III Wasabi's and 99% of the population won't know what the fuck they are. I just flat out love the colorway and the wasabi concept. If there were replicas of these that I could buy I would because while I love them I'm still trying to save some money and despise paying resell. 

Think about it, it's fucking art you walk in! Some of us just simply, truly love a pair of sneakers for what they are. No hype, no flex, no cap!",73,19,2020-05-29 16:19:31,Repsneakers

asics,[REVIEW] Nike x Off White Vapor Max (Black) from Sneakerahead (David),"Here are a few pictures before I get going, some warning, I am not a photographer by any means:  https://imgur.com/a/GMePm

EDIT: One picture didn't upload, the text on the side, here it is https://imgur.com/a/r1TiJ

Here we go, one bite everybody knows the rules. 

Well I'll be completely honest, I don't really buy sneakers or anything like that anymore nor have I been up to date on the replica game in the same way, so I have no way of picking the flaws apart so you guys are welcome to do that in the comments. 

I've looked at pictures on the internet of the retails, and they look pretty good to me on feet and when I have them in hand, so no real complaints there. They came with the zip tie and three pairs of extra laces (neon green, orange and black). I'm going to give them a 9/10 tentatively. 

After QC pics from David which I received in about a day and a half, they took 6 days to get here through DHL, solid. 10/10 on service. 

Comfort: They took a little while to get used to walking on air bubbles after wearing Boosts and Asics for the last year of my life, but they fit TTS and have real comfortable knit, a little narrow if anything. 9.5/10. 

Overall a tentative 9.6/10.

asics,Huge 8kg haul Review + Finds,"I've been into reps for almost a year, but only discovered agents (I use CSSbuy) and taobao/yupoo recently. My friends are also getting into now, so I buy a lot for them. I also live in mainland US.

I liked CSSbuy's interface for the most part and they're super nice, just can be pretty slow getting packages out, but shipping was crazy fast for me once shipped. 

Anyways, I ordered my first mini haul to test the waters, then started with the more intense orders. I split up parcels to 2 pairs / parcel shipping with DHL and no boxes. No issue clearing customs or anything. Cost was fairly low (like 220-260 yuan a pop) but do remember that it is volumetric weight!

I don't have pictures of most of the shoes (other than QCs) just because my friends took them before I had time to take pictures.

asics,Eva Parley Ultra Boost,"ORDERING: 10/10 So as you guys may know, i had a previous run in with Eva and 2 pairs of yeezys. she has since solved that issue. i asked her if she would let me order from her again after that pain in the butt and she said ""ok."" she responded to me usually within 12hrs because of the time difference. so I can't fault her there. she even sent me more QC pics that i requested when i did not see them on her yupoo. when i got the box, there was a dent in the bottom corner, when i told her, she offered me $10 i respectfully declined. just goes to show that she fixed her customer service. i also got it double boxed so how it was dented I'm unsure.
Shipping was quick, came within 7 days from the time I placed the order. [pictures for reference](https://imgur.com/gallery/SnnXz)

THE SHOES: 10/10 Gotta love her 1:1 magic. they look identical to the ones in the pictures. the stitching looks tight and high quality, the colours were on point and started and stopped at the right spots, in other words, there was no fading and stuff. The prime knit was soft and stretchy, it might have been a tad bit thicker than the legit but i can't complain, it felt comfy and high quality. The continental rubber outsole felt tacky like my legit UB. and man oh man, the boost, the glorious boost. it was honestly like walking on a cloud. it felt more comfortable than my legit UB 3.0 it was absolutely mind boggling that these reps felt sooooooo good. 

SIZING: 9.7/10 TTS FOR MEEEE FAM but you could go half size small if u don't want the insole. up to you, i know some people like feeling the boost without the insole.

COMFORT: 15/10 sooooooo comfy. boost was soft, squishy and springy, i would be willing to run in these even though i stick to asics for running.
OVERALL: In the end, I‚Äôm quite happy with these. they look and feel great, Eva did a complete 180 degree turn compared to my first order. i am definitely going to be ordering more from her again. please disregard anything you might have heard about her, it is a great buying experience.",51,35,2017-04-25 06:25:21,Repsneakers

Anyways, this post isn't to ask any questions or anything like that. I just wanted to rant about how unbelievably shitty my luck is that my first rep order got seized fml. I contacted Muks to see if they can send me some more but they haven't gotten back to me yet. CHINESE GOV THINK THEY CAN HOLD MY REP GAME DOWN THEY GOT ME FUCKED UP.

UPDATE: Muks got back to me and said that it got through customs but the tracking number changed (???). I put in the new tracking number and it looks like it was made yesterday and got through customs yesterday. Super odd situation but whatever, they got through.

Price: $155 shipped

Fit: True to size, like any New Balance sneaker
Comfort: Super warm and comfy ‚Äî thanks to that Loro Piana wool and lining. Perfect for winter!

Shipping: Arrived in just 7 days post-QC confirmation.

Cons: A bit worried about the wool mesh upper. It feels fragile, and I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôll hold up long-term. I‚Äôll wear them for a few weeks and update you all on their durability.

Stay tuned for more updates as I really put them to the test!",34,6,2024-11-12 03:42:04,Repsneakers

The shipping was about 10 days.
The sneaker pays tribute to the world of running and incorporates materials like microfiber and mesh to offer flexibility and lightness.
It is a fine balance that truly appeal to a wider audience of luxury fashion consumers and the younger crowd.
The 'CD' logo adds a luxurious touch, an aerodynamic detail that is inspired by French modernism. 
I'm really happy!

adidas samba,Found these used Yeezy Turtle Doves at the thrift store. Not sure if they're real or reps. Put them on hold and want to check authenticity before buying.,"So I went to my local thrift shop and was looking for some great bargains.  Found a pair of Adidas Sambas, an Adidas camo shirt and and a RL Polo shirt at great prices.  Cool.  Then I glanced a pair of shoes that  I thought were maybe some Adidas Tubulars.  Went to take a closer look and picked them up.  YEEZY 350 TURTLE DOVES!  Then I looked further and thought, wait a pair of Turtle Doves at the thrift shop?  Can't be real right?  $24 listed price?  NO WAY!  Well just in case, I took a few pics of them and asked them to put them on hold.  I have until the end of the day to go back to the store and buy them.  So Yeezy authenticators of Reddit, please take a look and give me the verdict!  Real or fake?  Even at $24, still worth buying if they're reps and not easily call-outable?  LMK and thanks!  If they're real, it'll be like hitting the jackpot.  Almost like finding a Picasso in a garage sale kind of feeling (well maybe not quite but you get the picture \*no pun intended\*)
